    "content": "<p>In the morning, another servant visited the Spring Palace, carrying a tray of food. It was another blue robe, who looked smug and proud as he talked with the Queen, once again disguised as the maidservant. </p><p>He received no protective talismans. </p><p>Admittedly, now that I knew how it was made, I found myself questioning how actually received one. Drawing a talisman was a dangerous affair, requiring focus and strength … and most importantly, some sacrifice. </p><p>Its structure had to be stabilized, which required Qi that was subdued by the creator to act as a core. It was what allowed the talisman to last. The amount that was used varied based on many factors. Material quality, the skill of the creator, the strength of the talisman, the design of it … Under ideal circumstances, she could probably stabilize a weak talisman like the protective one she gave me with Qi she could subdue in minutes.</p><p>However, Spring Palace was not ideal. Nowhere near close. </p><p>Thanks to my ability to understand what Qi was, I started to get a better sense of the cultivation process. One of the most fundamental aspects … the processing speed of an Immortal Root was constant, regardless of the cultivation level. According to the Queen, it was impossible to improve the Immortal Root of a cultivator, with its nature and purity limiting the cultivator forever. </p><p>My system-enhanced bursts weren’t helpful either, because apparently, it was only useful to awaken the dantian and activate the first gate, which equaled the Qi-2 stage. From there on, there were specialized techniques to improve the first gate and activate the follow-up gates, which was critical for faster cultivation. </p><p>While the Immortal Root had constant, it still processed different types of Qi differently, so by essentially preprocessing Qi to a version fitting to the Immortal Root, the cultivation got faster … which meant, the follow-up cultivation techniques were extremely critical. </p><p>Unfortunately, when I tried to probe her more about the subject, she clamped up. Apparently, the meditation technique she had given me was pretty basic and relatively common, while the other techniques were more of a secret. </p><p>Ultimately, it was not critical. With the way my System worked, I could afford to show some patience. Especially since the Qi she passed me was not subdued Qi but merely purified one, yet, the System reward was already subdued. </p><p>The Queen was once again upstairs, but I didn’t know whether she was awake or not, meaning, I was limited in my actions. Instead of walking around, I pulled the cleansing talisman she gave to me, examining how it worked. </p><p>Ironically, it was doing something very similar to what I had been doing with my meditation technique, only weaker. It acted like a magnet, pulling the cursed Qi, and storing it in a unique storage component. </p><p>It was weak, but still, it would have cleansed my essence in less than a week if my poisoning problem was as bad as I reflected … inconvenient, as it meant there was no more pure Qi to heal me. Worse, my biggest excuse to stay was already gone. She could send me away the moment the alert level went down. </p><p>It was the time to take a little risk. </p><p>I decided to practice once again, but this time, I got naked. She might be a cultivator and a Queen, but she was also isolated and bored. I was hoping that she wouldn’t turn down some eye candy. Not something I initially planned to do, but the function of the cleansing talisman forced me to act faster.</p><p>Operation honeypot, initialized!</p><p>I practiced in my room but left the door cracked. Then, I turned to the sole mirror in the room and started practicing Forest Dance. I kept my moves to the Initiate set, and I didn’t use any essence since it was supposed to be cursed, but I still pushed myself to the limit. </p><p>I waited until I built a nice sweat before I started to make some noise, and closed my eyes. Since I was an expert martial artist, I needed an excuse not to notice her presence. </p><p>It still took more than an hour for me to hear her soft footsteps closing in, getting closer and closer to the door … only to freeze. </p><p>Success. </p><p>I gave no indication of noticing her presence, and continued to go through Forest Dance. I used that above the other martial styles, not just because she had seen me using that many times, but also because it was a calm, collected, and elegant martial art, far different than the utilitarian techniques the others used constantly. </p><p>Like a beautiful light drawing the butterfly close … </p><p>Then, without a warning, I threw one punch from Black Tiger Onslaught. Just one, but it was enough to break the monotony of the Forest Dance, its aura raw, merciless, daring … and, if I read the soft gasp she let out, very sexy. </p><p>It was a deliberate shift. She helped me a lot, but all the while, she was driven by her sense of pity. It had been different with Elsana. The general sense of pity she felt didn’t stop her when her competitive nature drove her to take the lead. </p><p>Not to mention, the source was different. Elsana pitied me, because I played a scholar about to lose his freedom to serve his family’s interest. For the Queen, I was the valiant yet injured martial artist. </p><p>Therefore, I used Black Tiger Onslaught when I was naked. It was rough and murderous, and even without using my essence, I could sense a slight shift in my mentality. </p><p>It paid off, and she stayed to watch, even as I alternated between the two, like I was using Forest Dance to keep my dangerous, wild nature chained. </p><p>Eventually, she still walked away, which was not a surprise. As much as I would have loved her to walk in directly so that I could show her a different style, she was too proud of it, even with her as the handmaiden. </p><p>Still, the impact was clear when she called me to share the dinner, which was followed by another lesson. Her gaze lingered longer, particularly when I acted like I was looking somewhere else, her gaze wandering. </p><p>The System confirmed it as well. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 15]</p><p>[45x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Major Familiarity]</p><p>[45x Return - Verdant Brush Talisman Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>[45x Return - Calligraphy, Perfection]</p><p>Losing some multiplier was unfortunate, but it was far better than being sent away for my own good. I slowly ‘healed’ from the cursed Qi. With the cleansing talisman in place, I didn’t receive any Qi blast in the first place, so my so-called sickness hurt more than help.</p><p>And, I started to increase the intensity of my naked practice sessions, and more often than not, I had a secret visitor enjoying the show. Another week passed in that routine, and things mostly stayed the same. I finally reached Perfection in the Meditation technique, and reached Minor Familiarity in the Talisman Technique, both I had already triggered. </p><p>In contrast, I reached Minor Immersion in Calligraphy, but that, I didn’t dare to trigger. I didn’t want to test whether cultivators could notice that light show somewhat.  </p><p> The most exciting thing was that she had another breakthrough in her martial arts — thanks to my hidden help — reaching the Advanced Bone Forging Stage, which increased the multiplier further. </p><p>She still tried to keep her martial cultivation a secret. </p><p>Normally, keeping one’s martial cultivation was not a simple thing. It required great expertise and talent. She cheated by using her Qi to cover her essence, essentially reversing my own trick of using essence to cover up my Qi. </p><p>It worked surprisingly well. I would have never guessed that she had already reached Advanced Bone Refinement without the system notification. </p><p>It got more interesting, when, at the end of our lessons, she asked me a fateful question. “Can you teach me martial arts?” she asked. </p><p>“Of course,” I said immediately, finally receiving the excuse I needed to push things more. “But, may I ask why?” </p><p>“I want to protect her Highness better,” she said. “Even the skills of an Initiate may prove critical.” </p><p>“It would be my honor,” I said, then raised my hand. “May I check your pulse, to check your talent?” I asked, blushing just a bit. With her attraction already in place, adding some shyness to the mix wouldn’t be harmful. </p><p>She lost some of her hesitancy at my display of vulnerability. She raised her hand, and I touched her wrist, forcing my blush to deepen at the touch. Then, I sent a blast of essence. </p><p>I had to admit, she had planned well. Not only did she keep her intense essence wrapped tightly to disguise herself as someone who had never practiced martial arts, but also she made several critical essence channels vital to achieve Muscle Reinforcement look like blocked, disguising herself as someone who could never go above Initiate Realm. </p><p>“I will do my best,” I said resolutely but mentioned nothing about her supposed lack of talent. “Any preference? I think I know enough to teach you about Imperial Sword?” I offered. </p><p>“How about Forest Dance?” she said, choosing a martial art that required a lot of touching, caressing, and otherwise close contact. Even with her veil, her smile was impossible to hide. </p><p>She clearly didn’t expect to learn anything, which worked well for me, as I didn’t want to teach either. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When the Queen woke up, she was showing signs of distress. “Are you alright, madam?” I said the moment she opened her eyes, but I lay on the bed, acting like I was in excruciating pain which I tried to keep suppressed bravely. </p><p>A tricky balance to maintain, but if her expression of concern was any indicator, I was successful. </p><p>“Don’t worry about me. How do you feel?” she asked. </p><p>“Nothing I can’t handle,” I said, but used every non-verbal clue I had to convince her that I was actually in distress. </p><p>“Very well,” she said, but her actions made it look like she didn’t believe me. She walked to me and put her hand to my temple once more. Another jolt of Qi, this time less than half as strong. Yet, I barely managed to keep myself from shouting in happiness. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - 2 Qi Strands]</p><p>There was no drop in the cultivation difference bonus. </p><p>Meaning, the System didn’t calculate Martial and Qi together, but added them. What an incredible benefit. Here I was, afraid that I had sacrificed a lot in return for my ability to manipulate Qi directly. </p><p>I acted like the pain turned manageable. “What happened?” she asked. “I — the Queen asked you to leave.” </p><p>“I tried, but suddenly, two men dressed in black attacked me. They weren’t using Imperial Sword. They failed, but one of them managed to destroy the talisman. Yet, when I defended myself and defeated them, a lot of guards appeared and started chasing me…” I started, giving her a fictional story of my escape that nonetheless fit everything she knew. </p><p>I deliberately mentioned one guard that helped to distract the others. </p><p>“I see. It’s my fault,” she said. “I should have told you to leave directly.” </p><p>“Nonsense, madam. It’s my own mistakes that pushed me down. You’re the one that helped me,” I said as I grabbed her hand. A forward move, particularly under the circumstances, but she didn’t pull her hand away. Not surprising. She was alone, and touch-starved, and I was a handsome and valiant martial artist who owed her big time. </p><p>She still pulled her hand after some delay, and I let her. No need to push her too much. “You have to stay here until things calm down. Then, I’ll arrange a way to get away,” she said, feeling responsible for my situation. </p><p>Good. Feeling guilty didn’t prevent her from feeling pity. </p><p>“Please, madam. Don’t risk yourself. I can’t live knowing a hair of you harmed for me,” I said. </p><p>“If that’s your wish. Then, stay in the bed and rest. Also, both the basement and upstairs are forbidden, so don’t move around. Understood?” </p><p>“Yes, madam,” I said, giving her a pitiful smile. I much preferred to give a seductive one, but, I planned to wait until I was sure she would respond in kind. </p><p>When she left, I pulled the book she wrote once more. I read the book carefully, not to learn more, but to find better questions to ask her. Now that I could sense Qi, I could ask her more pointed questions, but the only way to do so was to find appropriate sections in her book. </p><p>Freeloading was particularly difficult when it came to knowledge. </p><p>At the same time, I looked around the room and saw a top-quality brush set, accompanied by paper. The room was filled with dust but furnished impeccably. </p><p>I stood up, cleaned the place, and started writing several poems about martial arts to kill time. Also, since we would spend a lot of time together, I wanted her help in other subjects as well. It was a good way to keep the discussion from getting too one-sided. </p><p>Not to mention, it would create a reason for some casual touches. </p><p>My writing turned even more beautiful. My skill level might be the same, but my increased cultivation increased my motor functions along with my strength. </p><p>The fact that it was cumulative with martial arts boost was even better. Though, the effect was merely additive rather than multiplying, meaning, ultimately, it was a waste for a cultivator to learn martial arts unless they had no other choice. </p><p>Like the poor Queen that was currently hosting me. Whatever ailment she was suffering made her cultivation regress to the point that martial cultivation was the better option. </p><p>While writing, I kept my eyes closed, trying to feel the Qi around us. It was hard, though this time, it wasn’t about my lack of talent. Feeling external Qi was not a simple thing for others as well unless they had some rare talent according to Queen’s book. </p><p>It was the whole point of a meditation art. I grabbed a mote of Qi, which was the smallest piece that was floating, which was mostly cursed Qi, infecting the house despite the protections. Though, just by the amount it was invading my essence, I could say the amount was much lower compared to the outside. </p><p>No wonder the attackers tried to sabotage the protections. </p><p>“It’s time to earn my keep,” I thought as I started to gather cursed Qi and lock into my essence. Not only it would give me an excuse to extend my sickness, but also it would keep the environment of the house cleaner. </p><p>Therefore, helping the Queen to recover faster. </p><p>A nice little balance. </p><p>I started walking around the house, though, for the moment, I avoided the basement and the upstairs. The latter, because I wanted to respect her privacy, the former, I was afraid that whatever was too dangerous to deal with. </p><p>As I walked around, I gathered some more cursed Qi, ready to throw them out along with most of my Essence, which I could replenish with the food and the pills in my Inventory. </p><p>Though, as I walked, I made sure to walk slowly, like I was a sick person doing my best to stand straight. I walked around, but occasionally used one of the servant entrances to go out and push all the energy out. </p><p>The pure Qi, I left in the palace. </p><p>As I walked around, I started to get a better sense of what was going on. The pure Qi in the room was coming from upstairs, and the density got higher as I climbed higher. Likely some kind of cultivation environment she prepared for herself. </p><p>Whether the king — and the cultivators that forced the situation — didn’t know about it in the first place, or deliberately allowed it for some reason was a question I couldn’t answer. </p><p>Cursed Qi, on the other hand, came from the basement. There was some kind of barrier that blocked the flow, so it was just a drip. No wonder she warned me not to enter there. </p><p>After walking. I managed to get rid of most of the cursed Qi on the first floor. Which would, hopefully, make her cultivation easier. </p><p>The more Qi she had, the more she would be willing to spend to help me. </p><p>I split my time between reading the book and finding ways to push out cursed Qi without wasting essence. I was more successful in the former … but eventually, I would get a hang of the former. When the evening arrived, the cursed Qi invading the house got stronger. I still took in most, but left some behind, hoping to keep her from getting suspicious. </p><p>When she arrived downstairs, it was already midnight, yet she still looked exhausted. She saw me trying to clean the place, only to fail with the pain. I did that, not only to sell my pain but also to make sure the System continued to reward me. </p><p>Just in case she considered it a payment, now that I was not officially a servant. </p><p>“What did I tell you! Stay in the bed!” she admonished.  </p><p>“But … I want to ...” I started, then stopped to fake a spasm. </p><p>“No argument,” she said as she moved forward, grabbed me, and dragged me to my bedroom. “No leaving.” </p><p>When she dragged me, she noticed several papers, filled with questions. “Oh, you are already working on the book?” she asked. </p><p>“I can’t waste the Queen’s favor,” I declared proudly. “I have to work hard.” </p><p>“But you have some questions,” she said. </p><p>“I … yes, I have,” I said, looking ashamed. “I’m not that smart,” I said. </p><p>“Nonsense. You’re not even a cultivator, yet your comprehension is better. They should be ashamed instead,” she said. “Let’s work on them… But first, take this,” she said, giving me another talisman. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Cleansing Talisman, Yellow High-Grade]</p><p>I put it on my neck, and instantly, I felt some of the cursed Qi that affected me to weaken, turning into pure Qi. It was still not subdued, so I couldn’t use it to cultivate, but once I learned a technique, I could use it for it. </p><p>Meanwhile, I just found a way to help her. The System wouldn’t allow me to give the upgraded version to her … but what about using it myself. Another way to trick the System. </p><p>The class began, my pointed questions making it far more effective than its previous versions. She continued explaining … and using the talisman as an excuse, I even managed to get a quick lesson about the general concepts of talismans. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Major Familiarity]</p><p>[70x Return - Verdant Brush Talisman Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>[70x Return - Calligraphy, Major Accomplishment - Perfection]</p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>The trick Queen pulled was clearly not simple, as when she dragged me to her Spring Palace, she was visibly staggering. It was especially serious considering I could feel that she was using her essence to support herself. </p><p>Not the nicest thing, but it would be a lie to say that I was suddenly filled with guilt. I had already helped her a lot. </p><p>The moment we were inside, she put me on the bed … and collapsed to the nearest chair, already unconscious. Slightly frustrating, as it meant I couldn’t simply explore the house. And, her current state of unconsciousness gave me an excellent option to examine her cultivation, both Martial and Qi. </p><p>Though, I kept the cursed Qi to the surface. In case she woke up, I could always say that I was worried for her despite my deadly illness. </p><p>I started examining her martial cultivation first, which, despite her great growth, had been filled with blockages, tainted points, and creeping problems. The incredible cost of raising people with essence pills wasn’t the only reason for most martial artists to avoid it. It also created problems that were supposed to be impossible to solve. </p><p>Luckily, I cheated. Someone else trying their essence to handle the problem would have ruined her martial cultivation, but I immediately solved all but the most visible problems. And, those I kept to keep her unaware of my help. </p><p>The moment she solved those few problems, she would rise to the Peak of Bone Forging easily. </p><p>With those solved, I turned my attention to her Qi Cultivation. The last time I checked her gates, there was only a smattering of Qi remained, like I was looking at a dried well. Now, they were even emptier, like someone squeezed the ground. </p><p>It looked like her attempts to heal me wiped her off completely. </p><p>Digging someone's cultivation like I was doing was taboo, but I didn’t care about that. Instead, I carefully pushed through her first gate and finally got a glimpse of her dantian, the center of her body, where her Qi was to be stored and supplied to her gates so she could use them externally. </p><p>With my cultivation knowledge, I could see that her dantian was damaged. The Qi didn’t gather there correctly. Or, that was how it felt as I poked around with my essence. Lacking sensitivity to Qi didn’t make things easy. </p><p>However, while exploring that, I noticed a nice benefit. </p><p>It was possible to cover up Qi cultivation with essence. It wasn’t perfect, and it wouldn’t trick anyone into repeating my examination, but still, it would work. Especially if I was merely at the first level, and only activated my Dantian. </p><p>“A tough decision,” I thought. It was risky enough, especially if the Queen discovered what I was doing. Yet, I couldn’t help but hope that, by cultivating my Qi, I would be able to interact with external Qi. If true, that would be extremely helpful. </p><p>In the end, I decided to do it. Ultimately, I was betting that, if there was some kind of signal I couldn’t block, people would assume that Queen was responsible for it.  </p><p>First, I purged the cursed Qi from my essence. Then, I reached into my Inventory and pulled one of the Qi strands. The moment I did so, it melded against my body, making me very glad that I waited until my Meditation technique had reached Major Familiarity. </p><p>By that, I was able to channel Qi without actually being able to see it. I channeled my essence and drove the Qi strand into my Dantian. It felt like a fire burning in my stomach, but it passed quickly. According to the technique, it was supposed to take hours, but it passed with a flash. </p><p>More importantly, my Dantian, rather than feeling empty, felt already full. </p><p>A strand of Qi was far more effective than I expected. No wonder, even with that multiplier, I only received six of them. </p><p>I let my Dantian absorb and devour the Qi. It was a necessary step in cultivation. Dantian was the heart of cultivation. The stronger it was, the better the cultivation was. The impact might be limited, but I much preferred to keep my cultivation low to ensure higher multipliers. </p><p>However, I soon noticed another unusual thing. Nourishing it was supposed to take a far longer time. A cultivator slowly gathered and purified Qi until it turned a part of them, and then they could absorb…</p><p>Which suggested that the System provided me with subdued Qi like I had spent weeks to properly process it, so I could absorb it without problem. </p><p>Another incredible shortcut. </p><p>The moment I unlocked my dantian, I could feel my body getting stronger. Significantly so, like my body had been always running on a backup engine, and the real one had been just activated. </p><p>Tempting those capabilities was tempting, but not as tempting as finally seeing Qi. The moment I broke though, I gained the ability to detect my Qi directly. My dantian shone brightly with pure Qi. Meanwhile, what I called cursed Qi was dark, smelly, and tainted, making me want to throw up. </p><p>Yet, I kept it, because I needed to convince the Queen that I still needed her help. I hoped for another healing pulse. Qi Strand was valuable, considering one of them had been enough to make me a cultivator. </p><p>After a very brief of physical capabilities — that showed my physical capabilities were almost doubled, showing that Qi cultivation was far more effective than Martial Cultivation. Previously, I could barely contend against Peak Skin Refinement artists in a fair fight, and now, I was confident to deal with Intermediate Bone Forging Artists. </p><p>I didn’t expect my cultivation to happen that easily … well, maybe not easily, as I had a feeling, that not many Qi Gathering stage cultivators raised their meditation ability to the Major Familiarity before they started cultivating. </p><p>Curious of its impacts, I pulled the book she wrote for me, and started reading. “Wow,” I murmured, shocked by just how much easier it was to understand now that I was aware of my own Qi. </p><p>No wonder only a rare few could cultivate. To understand the techniques, one needed Qi awareness, which couldn’t be developed directly. Though, it couldn’t be just that. I continued to read her writings, and then process the knowledge that was granted by the earlier lessons. </p><p>After reading a bit more, I frowned and went to touch her wrist again. This time, I used my Qi to explore her cultivation. That way, I didn’t need to make assumptions blindly. Seeing her gates, I could see that they were damaged by an external force, which left many damages. </p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder if I could use essence to cleanse it … but I didn’t dare to experiment. I didn’t want to wound her. Instead, I peeked at her dantian and found a mess. Her Qi was messy and impure. But, at that moment, my attention was grabbed by something else.  </p><p>At the center of her dantian, there was an ethereal object, one that was slowly absorbing and cleansing Qi, and outputting subdued Qi. It was a weak mist, almost invisible. Multiplying it by a thousand times wouldn’t be enough to match the strand I had. </p><p>Yet, the moment I saw it, I realized one important detail. </p><p>My Dantian was missing something extremely vital. Something that allowed cultivators to interact with external Qi and convert it to their own. </p><p>Immortal Root. </p><p>Without it, cultivation was supposed to be impossible. Until now, I assumed it to be a theoretical concept, but it clearly wasn’t. I wasn’t supposed to be able to cultivate. </p><p>However, it seemed that the System didn’t care about that detail, which was excellent news. Finding myself in a new world where people could destroy cities singlehandedly, only to end up watching from the side would have been inconvenient.  </p><p>Though, it had an unwelcome impact as well. Even if I could find a source of pure Qi, it didn’t matter. I couldn’t absorb it, at all, which meant I couldn’t improve my cultivation on my own. </p><p>“At least, I don’t need to sit in a room, and look at an empty wall for years for cultivation,” I thought as I tried to manipulate cursed Qi in my essence again. It reacted. </p><p>Good. The technique I learned made it clear that there were great differences between Qi which cultivators used in their techniques, and Qi they used to improve their cultivation. The former didn’t need to be fully subdued. It depended on the technique, but most of the time, gathering Qi would be sufficient. </p><p>Meaning, I could fight like other cultivators, but couldn’t strengthen myself in any way but the System… Honestly, the more I interacted with the System, the more I realized how poorly its rules worked.d </p><p>As if that mysterious being just threw me here, fully confident that I would be dead long before it started to matter. </p><p>“Well, it’s a bet I’m willing to take,” I murmured. The poorer the rules worked, the easier I could survive.   </p><p>I lay back, carefully folding the book, waiting for the Queen to wake up. </p><p>Her help assistance just turned even more critical. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Two weeks passed after my first visit to the new Apothecary. </p><p>Pearyin’s arrival meant that my previous routine had changed a bit, but considering the benefits, I wasn’t exactly complaining. Every night, I visited the apothecary, my time split between refining pills and helping her train more. She was coming along well. Not only she was already at the Peak of the Bone Forging realm, but also her combat techniques were coming along nicely. At this point, I actually expected her to be able to last against other Bone Forging masters. </p><p> Naturally, with her progress, there had been a lot of rewards.</p><p>I had to admit, I was tempted to help a few more directly to create a team of loyal Connate Realm martial artists. Unfortunately, the strength of the cultivators was clear in my mind. Even an army of Connate Realm martial artists wouldn’t have helped against them. </p><p>No, I much rather try to keep everything under wraps. My anonymity was my biggest advantage. I was already pushing my luck by helping the Queen… But, at least, that provided me with cultivation knowledge. </p><p>And, it was paying dividends. </p><p>As for constantly coming in and out of the palace, that turned out to be even easier than I expected. The inner parts of the compound were defended better, but the outer parts had been ridiculously easy to get in and out once I understood the exact patrol schedule. </p><p>Every night, I moved out, refined pills, helped Elsana, and returned by the morning. The fact that I refined those pills from the plants from the garden added a beautiful irony to the situation. </p><p>Most of the pills I refined, I gave the Queen with her with the meal. She didn’t think that I was the source, as, during the first delivery, I made sure to warn her that the cook had changed, claiming that I was afraid of poisoning. </p><p>Obscuring the information that way helped. Her classes provided me with more information, particularly after she raised her realm to Bone Forging as well, though merely at the beginner level. Her martial talent — likely neglected due to her cultivation talent — when combined with the absurd number of pills I provided her, increased her cultivation further. </p><p>And, my cultivation knowledge rose alongside. </p><p>As evidenced by the latest notification that popped into my vision as I walked away to bring her lunch.  </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity - Major Familiarity]</p><p>Finally, I reached the next stage. Then, just as I was about to leave, she gestured for me to stop. “Yes, madam,” I said. </p><p>“The Queen asked me to give you this,” she said as she passed me another parchment, but I could see that it was not a last-minute decision. “She thinks that you still have potential, and wants you to find a better path than being a servant.” </p><p>Before waiting for an answer, she passed me two things. A tightly-wrapped booklet, and a written order that freed me from my contract. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique, Qi Gathering, Profound-Peak Grade]</p><p>That answered the other book. “Madam, I—” I started, trying to argue against, but she seemed determined. </p><p>“No, this is Queen’s order,” she said. “Leave. Not just the palace, but the capital.” </p><p>With that, she slammed the door close. </p><p>I barely held back my curse. Talk about being a victim of my success. I was too successful in showing myself to be a pitiful person, so she followed that. </p><p>I walked back slowly, wondering what to do. I couldn’t stop visiting her, but just barging in was also not an option. Even in exile, she expected to be obeyed, and by refusing that, I risked ruining all the goodwill I built. </p><p>Before I went to see the head steward and deliver the order, I did two things. First, I opened the book she gave me, examining it slowly and carefully. The first thing I noticed was the writing. It was fresh. She wrote it just for me. Not something that could be done in a night. </p><p>... showing that she had been planning that for a while, likely since she had received the cultivation technique. The question remained. Why? Did she just believe that I was wasting my talent as a servant? Or, did she have another reason? </p><p>Either way, I didn’t want to get away immediately. She was still my best option. </p><p>But, before making a decision, I crossed my legs and activated the latest lesson. The information rushed to my brain, and the familiar clicking sensation followed, like many complicated things that I had found problematic turned easier. </p><p>The difference was significant. Like, earlier, I was trying to sum two large numbers by counting with my fingers, and somebody taught me the proper way to do it. Many concepts that were complicated had been simplified, giving me hope that I could actually cultivate. </p><p>To use another metaphor, as far as Qi was concerned, I was a blind man. But, by increasing the meditation art to Major Familiarity, I found myself with the ability to slowly move around, particularly if I used displacement of my essence to feel my Qi. </p><p>Unfortunately, that didn’t mean I was suddenly a cultivator. I still needed a Qi source … well, discounting the weird corrupting Qi of the Spring Palace, but considering it was being used as a punishment, it didn’t sound like a good idea. </p><p>Still, finally having the ability to cultivate, even if it came with some restrictions, was a good idea. </p><p>I checked the book she wrote for me again, for once, actually understanding what was being described. Nine stages of Qi Gathering, starting with activating the Dantian, followed by activating eight gates with Qi. </p><p>And, after that, linking them together, creates the foundation for immortality. </p><p>Thousand Petals Meditation was limited to that, and to follow more, a proper cultivation technique was required. But, that was a problem for the far future. Instead, I wrapped the book again and stuffed it under my shirt. </p><p>I didn’t plan to cultivate based on her notes I had the System superior system version, but that didn’t mean it wouldn’t be useful. </p><p>Once that was determined, I found the head steward. “I quit,” I said as I pushed the paper in his hand. “As per the Queen’s decree, I’m leaving after gathering my stuff. </p><p>He froze in shock as I delivered the news to him, which was just enough for me to disappear around the corner, then went to where I hid my stolen guard armor. “Soldiers, arrest that servant,” he shouted. A nearby guard followed … but when he failed to find me, several others joined, raising alarm. </p><p>And, I just mixed with the guards. It wasn’t the easiest way of avoiding the search. But, I had a different aim. </p><p>I needed an excuse to defy her orders. What better way than to create a fake persecution. </p><p>“I saw him running that way,” I shouted, pointing in a random direction. “Quick, before he gets away.” </p><p>Soon, the chase turned chaotic. They might be searching for me due to a reflexive order from an irate Steward, but once I disappeared, that stopped being important. A significant number of palace guards were mobilized, searching for me. </p><p>In the opposite direction. </p><p>I had already removed the armor — and melted it with Volcano essence for good measure to avoid someone finding a discarded armor and realizing what I had done — sneaked back into Spring Palace garden and hid under the foliage. </p><p>I even added several scratches to my back like I was ambushed before getting away.  </p><p>I hoped that the Queen was already aware of my presence. But, even if she was not, I could still make a move when the night falls, which would give me a reason to stay away. As for the protective talisman, I had removed it, and let the corrupted Qi infect me, though I gathered it on the surface to make the situation even worse than it looked. </p><p>I needed an excuse to stay. Ideally, the classes would continue, but even if they didn’t, she was the best guide I had to point me toward a source of Qi that wasn’t cursed. </p><p>I lay in the foliage, happy that the palace grounds getting more and more chaotic, to the point that, the Queen, dressed as her maidservant, actually left the mansion and questioned the guards about the commotion. </p><p>I used the chance to get closer, as it showed that she had yet to notice my presence. On her return, I created some noise, which finally caught her attention. I pushed the cursed Qi to the surface even more and closed my eyes. </p><p>When she arrived, she gasped in panic. “Oh, no. Are you okay?” she asked. I didn’t answer, and she touched me. Once again, I felt my own essence move, showing that it was her Qi. My growing expertise allowed me to keep the cursed essence gathered around her probe, trying to convince her that it was far worse. </p><p>She seemed to believe it. “Oh, no,” she gasped as she touched my temple, and a jolt of Qi reached my body. It was far softer, and I absorbed it, its presence displacing some of the cursed Qi. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 40 (Capped)]</p><p>[70x Return - 6 Qi Strands]</p><p>Success. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Let’s make sure your body is in tip-top shape,” I said as I poured some massage oil which I refined with the pills. It was still helpful to her cultivation, but not enough to make it worthy of the materials it consumed. </p><p>Yet, it wasn’t useless. </p><p>“It’s … warm,”  she murmured as she sank her face to the pillow, her naked body under my control. I climbed to the bed, hovering above her after I got rid of my clothes as well. There was no ambiguity about what would happen. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t hurry up. No matter how much I felt pent up, she had worked even harder. She deserved it to be about her … well, at least, the first session. My hands danced on her back gently, caressing her spine getting rid of her accumulated stress and strengthening her acupuncture points more. </p><p>My fingers moved to her neck and shoulders, thinking of playing it slow. “Faster, please,” she moaned, the shyness in her voice incredible. </p><p>As much as teasing her by slowing down even more would be fun, it was the first time she asked something of me, and I wanted to nurture her independence. And, it wasn’t like what she wanted was a great sacrifice. </p><p>My hands sped up, exploring the sides of her beautiful breasts, her moans rising both in volume and frequency in quick order. Her moans rose. I could have kept my hands there, but variety was the key to the fun. </p><p>Particularly when my new abilities allowed me to play her body like a well-tuned instrument. Thanks to them, every sensitive spot of her body was open to me like I was a pirate with a treasure map. I sat on her thighs, and my shaft landed on her ass. </p><p>She started squirming helplessly, trying to hasten things even more. I expected her to ask for my help, but she did not. I had no intention of giving her an easy victory. “If you want something, beautiful, you have to ask.” </p><p>She froze at my words, but my hands slid down, working on the small of her back, making tantalizing passes. Her moans rose. “I …” she started, which died just a quick. </p><p>I chuckled as I continued at the same pace, no matter how her growing wetness called me. </p><p>“I … more,” she whispered. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, but rather than giving what she wanted, I turned her over, which gave me another view of her beautiful body. I took the same position, which was even more overwhelming with eye contact. She blushed as I started caressing her breasts, making her moan even louder. “Tell me if you need more,” I said. </p><p>She said nothing as I subjected her breasts to the same treatment her back received, but harder and faster. As I played with her nipples, her back arched, the pleasure hitting her hard. She squirmed helplessly under my touch, but it still took a long while for her to gather the courage to ask more. </p><p>Not one to waste time, I leaned forward and captured her nipple between my lips, adding another layer to our little fun. It only pushed her closer to the climax … one that would not arrive without her express request. </p><p>It took a while for her to realize that her eyes were wide open. “P-please,” she begged. </p><p>“P-please, what?” I asked. </p><p>“Do … it,”  she whispered. </p><p>I chuckled even as I moved higher while I took the position for simple missionary fun, creating a line of kisses as I climbed up. Her collarbones, her neck, her cheek, yet I avoided her lips. “Do what, sweetie? You need to be more explicit. You’re the big bad martial artist, and I’m just a poor masseuse helping you.” </p><p>“I … I want you to … fuck me. Please,” she begged. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I grabbed her arms to spread them, and slid in. I sealed her lips with mine. She responded aggressively, showing that her lips weren’t as hesitant for tasks other than speaking. </p><p>My hands stayed around her wrists, keeping her prisoner even though she had the raw strength to break me if she wanted. A fight would have been different, but this close, I was at her mercy. </p><p>Something must be wrong with me because that made the moment even more tempting. I moved fast, invading her body aggressively until she started shuddering. Her climax. </p><p>However, no matter how intense the pleasure was, it wasn’t enough to make her faint like the previous time, not with her current martial cultivation. </p><p>I pulled out, letting her catch her breath for a moment — though my repeated kisses made that process far slower than it was supposed to be. </p><p>“M-more,” she whispered </p><p>This time, I ignored it as I lay down. “I’m tired,” I said. The disappointment on her face was beautiful. She looked like someone stole her favorite dessert, right after she took a spoonful to remind her just how good it tasted. I let my smile widen before I continued. “You’re going to have to work if you want the next one,” I added. </p><p>Her expression of realization was incredible. She wanted, to but was still hesitant. I decided to help her somewhat. “Well, how about this,” I said and gave her a quick breakdown of reverse cowgirl. An easy position, that not only helped her to set the pace but also allowed her to look the other way, giving her a sense of privacy. </p><p>Well, it would have been … if it wasn’t for the mirror at the corner, still allowing me an excellent view of her body, but she was too distracted to realize that detail. Her eyes were already closed. </p><p>“Sit on it,” I ordered, helping her a bit more despite my initial intention. I was such a softie, right?</p><p> Definitely. </p><p>My reward for my extremely selfless actions was quick to arrive. She positioned her wetness as she slowly sank down, no doubt trying to perfect her task. She sank down, her warmth covering me while I enjoyed the view of her tight, glistening ass…</p><p>Then, she started moving. </p><p>I couldn’t help but moan as she rode me hard, her hands already on my legs for leverage. I couldn’t help but realize that it was another benefit of the martial arts. She might be inexperienced when it came to sex, but her enhanced capabilities meant that she was still able to set her pace perfectly just after an explanation. </p><p>She didn’t hold back, her amazing breasts dancing with each second, her beautiful folds wrapping me tight. At the same time, I was glad for my own cultivation, and the incredible control it granted to me. Otherwise, just her reflection in the mirror where she bit her lower lip to keep a moan down while her breasts danced, combined with her tightness, would have been enough for me to blow my load completely. </p><p>Instead, I crossed my arms behind my back, enjoying the most incredible service I had received in … well, ever. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my apothecary knowledge, I might have treated the moment differently. Luckily, that particular skill set had quite a few useful advantages. </p><p>Rather than pulling out, I exploded in her. And, when she noticed that, she sank even deeper, taking all of it. It was glorious. </p><p>I took a deep breath, enjoying the view as Pearyin trembled, already thinking of the next steps to celebrate her new realm. </p><p>My new life might be far more dangerous than I even dared to imagine … but I was starting to believe that it was worth it… </p><p><br></p>",

To my surprise, everything continued without the slightest change. </p><p>Other than a completely new set of guards. A cover-up. </p><p>I acted unaware as I brought her breakfast once more. The Queen answered, once again in disguise, looking exactly like she always did. It took everything I had to cover up my shock, as I could sense no sign of essence on her. </p><p>“Good morning, madam,” I said as I passed the tray, and I used the opportunity to touch her finger slightly, which had been enough for me to sense some kind of barrier over her gates, similar to the protective talisman. </p><p>I relaxed. She was hiding her cultivation. It was good because it meant she didn’t want to ask for my help with her cultivation, which might have jeopardized our lessons. </p><p>She disappeared for a moment, supposedly to accompany the Queen while she ate. Instead, she started </p><p>“Now, where were we. Yes, the importance behind the conceptualization of the petals…” she said, once again continuing with the lecture. </p><p>Four hours later, I had my notification once more. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 20; Pity Bonus - 30 (Capped)]</p><p>[50x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>An excellent reward. It might still be the beginner class, but the improvement was incredible. I wanted to work harder and harder, which gave me a chance to push for more. </p><p>Just like that, another routine started. The only difference, the multiplier increased significantly. Unfortunately, that also meant I needed pills, better pills than I could create while being hidden in the corner. </p><p>Luckily, I already planted the exact thing I needed to arrange that particular thing. When the evening arrived, I took the risk of sneaking out. Finding a new apothecary store wasn’t exactly easy when I had to move around for a while. </p><p>It was midnight when I arrived. Pearyin was on a desk, working hard. I checked the material. She was trying to learn how to write. </p><p>It was rude, but I couldn’t resist the temptation. “Don’t hold the brush too tight,” I said. She flinched in fear but reacted better than I expected. She threw the brush at me, which flew fast enough to kill an ordinary man. </p><p>“Not bad,” I said as I pulled down my cloak. </p><p>“Y-you’re here,” she gasped as she dashed forward, hugging me. I could feel her trembling, but by touching her, I could feel no sign of physical damage. She was just stressed. </p><p>Not that I blamed her. I asked her to move to the capital, the only place where her current cultivation was unable to ensure the limits. I said nothing, just let her hug me while she calmed down. I started rubbing her shoulders gently. And, since it was a good opportunity, I finally used my improved essence massage. </p><p>The results were spectacular. I could feel her martial cultivation as clearly as mine, each touch improving her abilities more. </p><p>“Yes, I’m here,” I said. “Things worked well enough, so I arrived earlier than I planned. Now, tell me how was your travel.” </p><p>“Exciting,” she said, though while she tried to sound brave, I could feel her stress. “There was some increase in bandit attacks, but as you asked, I spent some money to change horses often, which helped me to avoid the worst. But, I barely avoided the mess.” </p><p>“What mess,” I said. </p><p>“The increase of savage beast attacks,” she said, her tone implying that I should have heard that. But, she was too respectful to question me. “About a week or so, the beast numbers increased significantly. There are some caravans that fell despite having Skin Refinement guards.” </p><p>No wonder she was stressed. </p><p>It didn’t take a genius to guess who was responsible. Lord Eirto, or more likely, the forces behind him.  Otherwise, what were the changes of beast attacks increasing, giving just enough time for his forces to retreat? </p><p>The war in Markas was clearly not over. But, it was not my problem. Especially not until I could get a handle on this cultivation business. </p><p>“Not for long. I have a mission still,” I said and felt her disappointment. “But I will be visiting frequently,” I said, and she relaxed. “Now, show me how much you improved during your travels.” </p><p>The answer, as it turned out, was almost none, but if her expectant expression was any indicator, not for lack of trying. Her talent wasn’t good enough, and our unorthodox cultivation process didn’t help. Her foundation and comprehension are terrible. </p><p>Luckily, I had a suitable workaround. </p><p>“Why don’t you prepare the bedroom for a massage while I refine a few pills,” I said. Luckily, the place she purchased had a nice workshop as well. There was no cauldron, but I had many in my inventory. As for herbs, I had collected more than I could use from the palace garden. </p><p>While she prepared everything, I started refining pills to facilitate a breakthrough in Bone Forging Realm. Difficult with my cultivation, but the quality of the medicinal plants from the palace garden was enough to bridge the gap. </p><p>Good, as breaking through to help the Queen improve would have been counter-productive. </p><p>I kept the better pills for the Queen. As I would be there to help Pearyin. I also refined some weaker pills for her to sell. </p><p>I needed funding, and selling pills was a good source as any.  </p><p>When I arrived in the bedroom, I found her on the bed, with a towel but nothing else. Far more daring than our last encounter, particularly with her enthusiastic smile. She didn’t say anything, but she didn’t need to, not with the excited smile she was wearing. </p><p>As much as I wanted to spend the whole night answering her needs, helping her breakthrough was more important. I didn’t know how effective a Minor Immersion essence massage would be, but I couldn’t afford to be late. </p><p>It was better to finish first.  </p><p>“Work first. Take the first pill,” I said as I put my hands on her shoulder, and started rubbing. </p><p>Even with my lofty expectations, its effectiveness surprised me. My fingers danced as I channeled the essence far smoother than she could ever do on her own. “Now, listen carefully. The real nature of the Forest dance…” I started, by delivering a lengthy lecture about the nature of it. </p><p>Combined, her cultivation improved rapidly, easily bypassing her lack of talent to push to the absolute Peak of Skin Refinement … then to the Bone Forging realm. It didn’t even take half an hour. </p><p>“I … I broke through,” she said. </p><p>“Yes. Don’t move so I can help you settle it,” I said as I continued massaging her back, doing my best to ignore the nature of her quickening breaths. </p><p>Until I could not and pulled the towel away…  </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>“Well, that’s interesting,” I murmured as I once again walked away from the Cursed Palace, noticing something unusual with the guards. </p><p>Another week passed since I convinced the Queen to add lectures on the cultivation techniques to the mix, but there was little benefit. </p><p>I had received a long lesson every day, which then had been improved by the System. Yet, the classes were still at the beginner level, showing that cultivation was far more sublime and complicated than I had assumed. </p><p>If I tried to study it alone, I would have died of old age before I could make even the slightest conclusion. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t waste my time. While I spent my days playing the genius servant, I spent the nights observing the palace forces, hoping to find a way to infiltrate them. Luckily, as a blue-robed servant, it wasn’t suspicious for me to walk around and give orders, which gave me some small advantages. </p><p>Including a set of uniforms. Unfortunately, I had to steal it, meaning no convenient armor in my Inventory to be used in an emergency. </p><p>I was confident in disguising myself as a guard because I managed to copy the Imperial Sword, which turned out to be even easier than I expected. I didn’t even need to ask someone. Just by passing near the training grounds, I managed to decipher it enough, at least enough to create a convincing fake. </p><p>After mastering many martial arts Minor Immersion, it had been a trivial achievement. At the same time, by observing them constantly, I learned something important. </p><p>The current guards were fake. I was alerted by their careful examination as I walked away, as normally, they didn’t care about the movement of the servants that much. In the palace, their presence was more ceremonial. </p><p>And, once I examined them, it was easy to see they didn’t know how to use the Imperial Sword just by their stance. Their center of gravity was misaligned, and they were clearly unused to the traditional armor. </p><p>Yet, their disguise was good enough to avoid the attention of any servant, so I couldn’t alert the guards. </p><p>I decided to visit my room to put on some makeup to look order while wearing the helm, change into the armor — and leave the protective talisman, in case the Queen could detect its presence. I could always purge my essence later. I also took the essence pills I managed to refine during that period with me, once again leveraging my expanded access. </p><p>I had two reasons for my presence. First, I wanted to save the life of the Queen, who was, without a doubt, my best chance to step into the path of Cultivation properly. Even if learning cultivation art proved useless, she was still the best contact I had in that world. </p><p>Also, I wanted to see if I could use the opportunity to improve her cultivation. I still had some acupuncture needles in my Inventory that I could use, and I had enough practice to enhance her abilities in the Skin Refinement realm at a minimum. </p><p>Maybe even higher if possible. </p><p>After going in and out for weeks, finding a location to observe the suspicious soldiers was easy. They waited until midnight, and then two of them split. Four stayed back, observing. I followed the two, staying at a distance.</p><p>As I moved, I could feel my essence getting dirtier far faster. Yet, I silently followed the two without cleansing it. I could always do that later. Even with the intensity during the night, it wasn’t as intense. </p><p>I expected them to attack the Queen, but instead, they split into two, pulled talismans, and started moving around. I let them get away sufficiently before I closed in, and once one glowed, they started digging. </p><p>I didn’t feel like they had good intentions. Though, as I approached carefully, I noticed the corruption speed getting weaker. Which gave me an idea about exactly what they wanted to do. Still, I waited until he unearthed what he was seeking completely. </p><p>Another talisman, but this time carved in green jade. </p><p>He was clearly a martial artist, at least at Peak Skin Refinement, but that didn’t matter when I pulled a set of needles from my Inventory and approached him from behind. He was too distracted and too confident of his security to notice my presence. I grabbed his neck and stabbed a few needles before he could react … and he fell unconscious. </p><p>A benefit of my increased capabilities. </p><p>The second one was equally easy to deal with. They were too confident in their success, which had been interesting. Yet, while dealing with the second, I drew my sword and hit against his armor deliberately. </p><p>Not enough to alert their allies, but just enough to alert the Queen, who looked down from the window, for once her veil was not on. </p><p>She was beautiful, but her exhaustion was equally clear. She said nothing as she examined me. “You’re not a guard,” she said. It was easy for her to guess as I had already shifted my stance to Dragon Saber. The difference in two stances was sufficient even for an amateur, which she certainly was. </p><p>“No, just a concerned party,” I said, changing my speech pattern completely to sound ancient. Yet, I deliberately showed no respect to her. </p><p>“I hope that you don’t expect a reward,” she said proudly, showing no hint of fear. </p><p>“No. Your survival is reward enough. The distraction you provide is enough for my master,”  I said. “They are interested in keeping you alive.” </p><p>“Until I outlive my usefulness, I’m guessing,” she said, her bitterness clear. Not that it shocked me. The gossip implied that she was abandoned by her family, and she was definitely abandoned by her husband.</p><p>“Your only use is to provide a distraction,” I said with a shrug. “The longer, the better. Feel free to take any better offer,” I said. </p><p>She was prideful but also desperate. “What do you offer?” she asked. </p><p>“Enough strength to deal with the rabble,” I said, kicking the unconscious man. Then, I flashed a needle. “As long as you’re strong enough to handle the pain, of course.” </p><p>“And what if I refuse,” she said. </p><p>“We’ll do our best to find another distraction,” I said, not giving her anything more. Then, I said nothing else. I didn’t either, waiting under her window. </p><p>“Wait outside,” she said. While she came down, I quickly went to the perimeter to check the other four … and found them already gone. I wondered if they saw what was going on, or if they had no intention of waiting for their allies in the first place. </p><p>Either way, it didn’t matter much. </p><p>I moved to the familiar palace door, where she lectured me repeatedly. She was already waiting for me. I couldn’t feel amused at the irony. She taught me, disguised as a servant. And now, I was going to teach her, disguised as a mysterious guard. </p><p>I did. When she appeared, I passed her the sword. “Follow my moves,” I said as I guided her through the Dragon Saber moves. She was quick to learn them. Too quick. Nowhere near my true capability, but still significant. “Take this,” I said as I passed her the first pill. She paused, examining it for a moment, probably enough to recognize what was going on. </p><p>I could see that she hated the lack of control, but despite her distaste, she took the pill. At the same time, I stabbed the needless to her neck and hands, which was enough for me to channel my essence even without touching otherwise. </p><p>Massaging was a fun idea, but not under our current circumstances. Instead, I touched the needle and channeled the essence. I noticed several interesting things. One, I could feel some — now familiar — presence in three of her gates, remnants of Qi. </p><p>It showed that she reached the fourth level of Qi Refinement, but as I suspected, her cultivation regressed. Her teachings helped me to assess that much. </p><p>More importantly, I noticed several of her acupuncture points were blocked. It wasn’t done by cultivators, but a martial artist, but the essence type was not one I recognized. </p><p>If someone other than a very skilled apothecary taught her Martial Arts, she would have died while breaking into Muscle Reinforcement. And, her quick acceptance of my teachings implied she didn’t know that.  </p><p>I thought about warning her against trusting anyone who might teach her Martial Arts, but then I realized it would reflect badly on my servant identity, so I kept my mouth shut. </p><p>Instead, I cleansed her acupuncture points and helped her to break through. With her incredible yet underutilized talent, combined with my absurd assistance, she broke through even faster than I expected. Ten minutes — and several pills —  later, she was at Muscle Reinforcement, and half an hour later, she reached Skin Refinement. </p><p>Cheating with resources was easy yet fun. </p><p>“Continue practicing,” I said after I fed all the pills I had, which pushed her to the peak of the Skin Refinement, and also showed her how to break through further. Unfortunately, that was my limit. “It will be inconvenient for us if you die early. Though, we might send you some gifts with your meal,” I added. Hopefully, it would be believable enough. </p><p>With the mysterious delivery from an even more mysterious agent complete, I went back. </p><p>And spent the rest of the night pushing out the corrupting Qi by repeatedly forcing out my essence. It wasn’t a pleasant experience, but it was worth it. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I was excited when the darkness finally arrived. Once I reached my room, I checked a dozen times to make sure there was no one around before I finally pulled it off, trying to read the scrap parchment. </p><p>It was an interesting experience. It looked like a bunch of meaningless scribbles that nonetheless hurt me just by looking at it. I might have even treated it as a practical joke if I didn’t receive the System return, confirming it as a genuine article. </p><p>Then, I noticed that every time I looked, I saw a different pattern. Like it wasn’t confusing enough. </p><p>Of course, there were many problems. Cultivators were rare. Ridiculously rare. And, if they were simply recruited from the rich and powerful, or kept insular, that would be easy to understand. But that wasn’t the case. There were enough stories about the sects picking a random orphan as a disciple, claiming fate and talent to suggest that cultivation required a rare talent. But, whether such talent only made things easier or actually critical, was harder to access. </p><p>If that was the case, I doubted that it would help. </p><p>Then, there was the other problem. The parchment was missing a lot of critical information, to the point that even multiplying it ten times didn’t complete it. Not that I blamed the Queen, as even a scrap was a treasure. </p><p>Cultivation information was not something that could be purchased at the market. </p><p>It was even more true for the improved version that was safely resting in my Inventory, but I dared not to remove it yet. Instead, I kept reading, hoping to find out something. After all, I was able to improve easily when reading Tiger Fist. </p><p>… Then, I remembered a critical detail. I had improved because I had received a very valuable pill from the cultivator, which then had been improved by my biggest multiplier yet. And, with my advanced apothecary knowledge, I had no idea how expensive the original pill was. But, I had a feeling that both Elsana and Marana would be willing to sell everything they owned for it, and still think that they profited from the deal. </p><p>I highly doubted I would be able to receive an equivalent pill for cultivation talent easily, and that assumed that they existed in the first place. No, that seemed like an unwise process. </p><p>That didn’t prevent me from spending the whole night, trying to understand despite the painful headache. And failed, utterly and completely. </p><p>The next day, while I brought her the breakfast, I decided to pull another risky trick. “Please thank the Queen for her generosity,” I said. “It helped more than I could ever imagine. I saw a Thousand Petals while reading that endlessly.” </p><p>“Really,” she said, her shock palpable. “How!” </p><p>I had only planned to impress her slightly by faking some understanding by giving the impression of the name. Unfortunately, her reaction showed that it was a bigger problem than I had realized. “Just an impression. Thousands of petals, dance in the wind. I felt that it was very similar to my Forest Dance,” I said, trying to undervalue my achievement and create a valid excuse for my comprehension at the same time. </p><p>It looked like my quick adjustment worked well, and she lost some of her shock. “Remove the talisman, and give me your hand,” she said. I did, trusting her not to harm me. From my impression, the biggest danger was for her to lose her pity. </p><p>The moment I removed it, I felt the subtle energy against my essence once more. </p><p>I didn’t expect to feel anything, which was why I was surprised to feel the slightest movement in my essence like something barged through one of the eight gates. It was a subtle shuffle, like a whisper, but it felt much different than the corrupt energy that infected.</p><p>I had a feeling that, the only reason I was able to even feel that was the extreme awareness I had of my essence due to a combination of my martial talent, and multiple martial arts. </p><p>Whatever she had been searching for, she didn’t find. When she stopped, I put the talisman back on. </p><p>Just like that, pity returned to her beautiful blue eyes. “So, it helped you to comprehend your martial art better. The Queen would love to hear her gift worked,” she said. </p><p>“Do you mind explaining some more,” I said as I pulled it. “Maybe it can help me comprehend my martial arts further. Maybe I can even recover completely,” I declared passionately even as I smiled.</p><p>The smile was one I practiced many times, one that gave an excellent combination of boyish charm and attractiveness, which tickled both the maternal instincts and sex drive of a bored middle-aged housewife. I had used that exact expression to coax several expensive gifts, including a beautiful convertible back in my world. </p><p>Against a Queen who was under house arrest, starved out of human contact, the impact was even more intense. </p><p>“Maybe,” she said with the attitude of a kind teacher, promising to her student that Santa promised to visit the next year with double presents. Clearly, she didn’t believe that it would help to cure me. </p><p>Yet, she had nothing to do. “Never reveal even a word to anyone,” she said. </p><p>“Of course. My lips are sealed,” I promised. </p><p>“Thousand Petals Meditation is a wondrous technique that requires years of dedicated practice to even begin to understand. It takes its name from the way it gathers Qi motes around the practitioner. By forcing them to dance in a cycle, the practitioner could identify the exact type of mote they require and avoid taking an unwanted one …” she started. </p><p>That started a long lesson, half of it filled with philosophies and other stuff, but none of them meant the slightest thing to me. Either she was a terrible teacher, or my lack of talent was even worse than I presumed. </p><p>“And, that’s all I could tell you about Thousand Petals Meditation. I hope it has been useful,” she said. </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique Lesson, Beginner]</p><p>“Oh, believe me, madam. It has been very helpful. Let me show you,” I said as I once again took the stance, and went through the Forest Dance. I started displaying the competence of Major Accomplishment at first, but as I showed, I visibly increased both my competency and the intensity of my Essence, a level of improvement that would require months for another martial artist.</p><p>”Impressive. Maybe I should tell you more,” she said. </p><p>“Later,” I said. “It would be rude of me to delay her Highness’ lunch for my personal errands.” </p><p>No harm buttering her up while she was disguised. </p><p>Once I returned, I made sure to take a little break and visited my room before triggering the System reward. I still had some time to visit the kitchen, and I wanted to see if the enhanced lesson worked as well as I had hoped. </p><p>I closed my eyes, sat on the bed, and triggered the information, waiting for it, fingers crossed. </p><p>The understanding flooded my mind, along with the ability to manipulate Qi … but that didn’t give me the ability to sense it. In a way, it felt like having a ghost limb after amputation. </p><p>Unsettling. </p><p>Not that I was complaining. I realized that without the System turning the information I received into a nice bundle, I wouldn’t have understood it, no matter how much the Queen explained. </p><p>No wonder she felt pity. She must have assumed that I had some kind of super comprehension, but wasted due to my inability. </p><p>I ignored her decision-making, and pulled out the parchment once again, trying to understand what was written. This time, it worked better … slightly. It was still not easy. I felt like trying to read something, but everything but vowels had been erased thoroughly. </p><p>Still, an improvement. </p><p>I realized that, without the assistance of the System, I could have never started it. And, if cultivation talent was as rare as everything implied, no wonder cultivators were as rare as Bigfoot. I studied a bit more before I waved my hand in surrender. </p><p>Technically, I might receive some benefits from the scrap, but not in a timescale that would matter. Maybe months, maybe years… </p><p>No, it was much easier to convince the Queen to continue giving me lessons. After all, she was bored enough to treat that as entertainment. The only problem … the return was limited. Seducing her to trigger the Pampering effect was tempting, but ultimately, it wouldn’t be very efficient. </p><p>Teaching her was tempting, but I was afraid that helping her train would make her feel like it was an equal exchange, which would ruin the opportunity. </p><p>But, my experience with Marana gave me another excuse. Helping her was an option. She just needed to think that the source was different. </p><p>All I needed was a convenient disguise to teach her martial arts. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I received the necessary supplies, I returned to the garden and started working. It was challenging, not because of the difficulty of the work. But because the Queen was checking me from the windows from time to time.</p><p>And, to maintain her interest, I was trying to maintain an interesting balance. I needed to work hard, yet I needed to look like an elite warrior attending to his gardening hobby rather than a peasant on his farm. </p><p>My apothecary abilities proved useful in that. While I was with Elsana, I had learned a lot about tending to expensive — and often dangerous — medicinal plants, which translated well. It even allowed me to mix a few moves that carried the shadow of higher-ranking Tiger Fist moves, reinforcing the idea that I had been a stronger martial artist before my own misfortune. </p><p>I put a lot of effort in, because a story that she ‘deduced’ was a thousand times more effective than a story I have told verbally. Hopefully, it would be enough to stir her heart. </p><p>Hopefully, the Queen would find an echo of her own struggles in the story I was selling her. </p><p>Halfway into my work, I stopped, stayed still, then went to the signboard, pulled it down, and started working. I didn’t have the ability to infuse feelings into my writing, but repairing it was simpler. I started working on it slowly and steadily.</p><p>My Calligraphy was good enough to repair it in a minute, but I still carved it slowly. I even made sure to angle my body to catch the sun from a good angle, highlighting my looks even more. </p><p>After all, the whole point was to impress the Queen, who was at the other side of the door, watching me. </p><p>Once I finished working on it, I put the board back on. At the same time, the door opened. “The queen asks for her lunch,” she said, but didn’t comment on the board. </p><p>I didn’t say anything either, just nodding. “As you say, madam,” I said and turned. </p><p>“Wait,” she said after I took a step. “The Queen appreciates your work, and asks you to wear this,” she said. I took it, doing my best to hide my nervousness. It looked like a mere paper with a complicated pattern, with a string passing from the middle. </p><p>The ink was still fresh.  </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Protective Talisman, Profound High-Grade]</p><p>Wearing it bravely was far easier once the System confirmed what it was. More importantly, a talisman meant cultivation, meaning my work was not for nothing. The Queen actually had some connection with the cultivators. </p><p>However, I didn’t know if she actually was a cultivator, as just because the ink was fresh. It might just be the method of preservation. Even if she was a cultivator, she wasn’t a strong one, at least according to the System. </p><p>I didn’t waste much time, and just put it on. The moment it was in place, I felt the weird energy infecting my essence stop. It didn’t purify my essence, but it stopped the degradation. </p><p>I kept it out deliberately. “Aren’t you afraid of showing the favor of the Queen? It’s not a smart thing,” she said. </p><p>“Every favor has its risks,” I declared, showing the unique brand of stupidity that belonged to the young and successful. </p><p>Her body language indicated amusement. “Very good. However, Queen asked you to keep it hidden,” she said. I nodded and followed the request. “Also, make sure not to stay in the garden after nightfall,” she added. </p><p>“As Her Highness wishes madam,” I said. After handling the lunch delivery, I stayed in the garden, working diligently. Even the clippings I collected were worth hundreds of gold and could be used to fashion several types of poison and medicine. </p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t disappear from the palace. And, while I had room to myself, refining medicine was hardly the subtlest activity. </p><p>Of course, I wasn’t the only one aware of the potential value of the plants, so the steward took the clippings, but I hid a handful of the most potent ones. </p><p>As I lay on the bed, I pulled the talisman, examining it. It was incomprehensible, but the more I tried to read, the dizzier I got. I stopped, and examined the ink instead. It had dried under my shift, which reinforced my guess that she was a cultivator. </p><p>If it was true, even better. It would mean I could learn from her.</p><p>***</p><p>Two weeks passed, and our interaction had been limited to sharing words while passing the food. The rest of the time, I continued to work at the garden, while she watched from the window, thinking that she managed to stay hidden. </p><p>Meanwhile, during the night, I focused on exploring the essence. Particularly, I was trying to see if I could somehow enhance the nature of the Forest Dance by copying the feeling of the signboard. It felt rather fitting for a martial art called Forest Dance. </p><p>It worked better than I expected. After a week, I managed to enter the Minor Immersion realm for Forest Dance as well. However, none of my martial arts pushed me further… </p><p>I was starting to suspect that, to reach Major immersion, I needed to practice Black Tiger Onslaught, but I wasn’t willing to take that risk yet. </p><p>And, I could always use it to impress the Queen further. Her pity was nice, but Pampering her directly would have been much more beneficial if I could swing it. Particularly since she insisted on interacting with me disguised as a servant, making an approach easier. </p><p>Of course, she was married, but even under better circumstances, it didn’t stop me. The King was playing to the throne of undeserving husbands considering her current circumstances.</p><p>She didn’t give me anything after that first day, but the length of time that we spent talking got longer and longer, which allowed me to slip a few comments about my lifelong ambition that would never be fulfilled without going into detail, never saying it explicitly. </p><p>I needed to push her because I doubted she would just decide to throw me a bunch of extremely valuable and secretive cultivation material just because I kept her garden beautiful.  </p><p>It was why, for the last few days, I started practicing the Forest Dance at the entrance. Not for long, just a few minutes every time, right under the signboard. However, with each repeat, I increased the purity of the essence. </p><p>It was another calculated gamble. I needed to look capable enough to be interesting, but not capable enough to be actually useful. My supposed injury forcing my martial cultivation to regress was a part of it. More importantly, I was hoping that, as a cultivator, ultimately, she would never truly value a martial artist. </p><p>Especially one that could never reach Skin Refinement. </p><p>It was important. I couldn’t afford to be anything more than a curiosity to her to trigger the System. </p><p>I was going through the same routine once more when the door opened, and the Queen appeared. “It looks interesting. What is it called?” she asked. </p><p>“Merely a collection of a few moves. It doesn’t deserve a name,” I said dismissively. </p><p>“Really. I’m not a martial artist, but I have seen many. It  doesn’t look like it.” </p><p>I shrugged. “Just a small remnant of my lost ambition,” I said, baiting her to ask more. </p><p>“Ah, that ambition. What was that?” she said. </p><p>“I dreamed of finding a way to reach above the Connate Realm,” I said, giving a deep sigh that implied that not only had I failed, but also it was the source of my current injuries. </p><p>“You sound like you have given up,” she commented. </p><p>“When ambition burns too bright, all that remains is a charred leaf, blown away by the winds,” I answered, indirectly telling her that I had given up. </p><p>She looked at me seriously, but her pity was palpable. “And, you just gave up?” she said. </p><p>“Diminished as I am, there’s no hope,” I delivered calmly like I was commenting on the certainty of day and night, hoping that she found an echo of her own dilemma. “I’m just killing time.” With that, I took a stance, and started going through the Initiate moves of Forest Dance, though keeping my expertise to Major Accomplishment. </p><p>Still a fascinating show, but nowhere near impressive enough. </p><p>When she sighed before walking inside, I thought that it failed. “Wait here,” she said, leaving the door open as she went inside. Then, she returned with a tattered parchment. “Take it,” she said. </p><p>[Pity Bonus - 10 (Capped)]</p><p>[10x Return - Thousand Petals Meditation Technique - Incomplete, Profound-Low Grade]</p><p>I looked at it, one that carried an incredibly confusing pattern that hurt me even worse than the talisman. “This is…” I said, acting like I had no idea of what it was. </p><p>“A test from the Queen. She says that she might be willing to help you if you can understand it,” she said. “But, never reveal it to anyone, or even she couldn’t save you from death.” </p><p>“I will make her proud,” I said, a sudden shift in my attitude, acting like I didn’t notice her sad expression. It was clear that she had no expectations for me to actually understand what was written there. </p><p>Luckily, I was cheating. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing as I waited my turn in a sea of gray-robed servants, while an old man wearing a black uniform pointed to each servant one by one, assigning them to their task. The majority had been assigned to keeping the gardens and outer perimeter clean. </p><p>I was one of the few blue-robed servants, wearing a deliberately smug expression like it was an achievement. I wouldn’t have been assigned to anything remotely important, but the other blue robes were assigned to better locations. I was doing my best to show off a cultivation at the Peak of Initiate Realm, which was impressive for a servant. </p><p>I was given a blue robe, because bringing food to a royal was an important mission, and couldn’t be assigned to a lower-ranked servant. Even to one that consigned to a slow death. </p><p>Then, the man stood in front of me with a genial smile, but I didn’t miss his vicious gaze. “And, since you’re a trained scholar, you’ll have the honor of bringing food of the Third Queen, who’s resting in the Spring Palace to recover from her illness,” he declared. </p><p>The other servants started gossiping wildly, their eyes wide with jealousy. The name of the Cursed Palace was a nickname among the guards, and mostly, they were smart enough to keep their mouths shut. It was not a secret, but also it was not known by the commoners as well. </p><p>What followed was a detailed explanation about exactly how to treat the Third Queen even when I was passing the food. Of course, a Queen not even having a servant would have been scandalous enough, but the illness excuse explained that.</p><p>It wasn’t absurd theater. </p><p>A grin blossomed on my face as I started walking, and it turned into a solemn expression. Trying to earn the pity of an imprisoned Queen as a servant consigned to death was a fool’s errand. I had spent enough time with the rich and successful to know exactly how they thought. They might preach equality, but it wasn’t true empathy. </p><p>I didn’t need the Freeloader System to know that pity was a fragile emotion. </p><p>I expected that to be only worse for an imprisoned Queen, as not only her sense of superiority would be well-established, but also her personal distress was real. </p><p>The only way to earn her pity was to find a way to touch her emotional strings … which would have been much easier if I knew anything about her. </p><p>I had to improvise. </p><p>I sighed as I walked forward, taking note of my surroundings as I finally stepped into the garden. The palace had many guards, but none of them dared to step into the huge garden.  </p><p>The garden was filled with plants, green mixing with various colors, but it was left to grow wildly. The smell was amazing, and I could identify several very expensive medicinal plants, the kind that required hundreds of gold pieces to buy at the market, abandoned to grow wildly. </p><p>Not exactly what I imagined considering the unofficial title of the Cursed Palace. </p><p>I walked forward, proud, but with a grim expression, like I was about to walk to my death. More importantly, I stopped suppressing my current martial abilities once the guards were sufficiently away. </p><p>Halfway in, something shifted. </p><p>It was hard to pin down exactly what was the change. I continued walking, not giving any sign of noticing anything wrong. No need to take any pointless risks just because I was confident in escaping. </p><p>I continued to walk solemnly, acting unawares when I noticed a slight movement in one of the windows. The Third Queen, most likely. The closer I got, the less I hid my abilities, adding the grace of a Tiger to my steps. </p><p>As far as martial arts were concerned, it was a good choice. While I was in Markas, I learned that three martial schools functioned in more territories than just the Zaim Kingdom, though usually they had different variants. At this point, I could easily create my variants or use the orthodox version for the Zaim kingdom, which gave me some flexibility for my story. </p><p>The slow pace allowed me to pin down the exact source of my discomfort. It was my essence. It was somehow being tainted. With what, I didn’t know, but I decided to leave it for the future. </p><p>I arrived at the door, knocking three times just like I had been asked. There was no answer, but I heard footsteps from the other side. She was probably watching me from a concealed window, but I didn’t look around to find it. </p><p>I was glad that, the door was positioned in such a way that it wasn’t visible from outside. I just needed to worry about her.</p><p>Instead, I focused on the cracked signboard. Spring Palace, it read. As I looked at it, I felt the whisper of a warm wind carrying the smell of fresh blossoms, but it came from a distance, garbled and broken. Yet, the crack seemed like a recent addition. </p><p>I decided to try my luck. </p><p>“Petals unfurl, a vibrant show; sun-kissed leaves begin to grow. But in my heart, a frozen spear; spring bloomed in vain, despair draws near,” I said, reading another poem. However, I read it differently. Previously, when I had been showing off back in Markas, I had been doing my best to sound high-class and educated. </p><p>This time, I put more emotions into my words, as they spoke to me. Though, I was still educated. Yet, the real trick was my accent, almost a perfect accent of Zaim Kingdom, but the slightest foreign edge only a trained ear could catch, implying that I came from afar. </p><p>At the same time, I shifted my Martial Essence slightly, copying Marana’s problem, which was even harder. Anyone below Elsana’s caliber would have concluded that I had been wounded in a way that prevented me from cultivating, and my cultivation had regressed significantly. </p><p>I didn’t show any sign of impatience, or continued to recite poems. The door opened almost twenty minutes later, revealing the Queen. Not much was visible behind the loose dress and the thick veil, only her eyes, but they were the bluest eyes I had seen, almost shining with their own lights. Yet, the lines around her eyes suggested exhaustion. </p><p>Whatever that was affecting her was hitting her hard. </p><p>Behind her, the palace was completely quiet and seemingly devoid of life. </p><p>“I have brought the Queen’s food, madam,” I said, acting oblivious to her true identity. </p><p>She said nothing, just looked at me carefully. “Another unlucky one,” she said, her voice sharp. “I wonder how long you will last with the curse.” </p><p>“Heavens weave as heavens will,” I answered primly. </p><p>I made no show of surprise, showing that I was already aware of the curse. Another big risk, but I had already committed to the brave yet cultured warrior who lost his future. She looked even more alert than I expected despite the sense of despair that radiated from her, and I didn’t want to risk changing my attitude. </p><p>For better or worse, I was committed to it, though it wasn’t as bad as it first sounded. If it didn’t work, I could always disappear. </p><p>I caught the slight shift in her gaze, confirming that I managed to surprise her. </p><p>Excellent. </p><p>“Interesting. You know about the curse, yet you’re not afraid,” she said as she took the food. “Let’s see how brave you are. Stay here until dusk, and clean the place.” </p><p>I met her challenge with a stoic nod. “As you wish, madam. I will go and bring the necessary supplies while Her Highness enjoys her breakfast,” I said. </p><p>She looked surprised, but I walked away. Once I was away from the garden, I found an empty room, and cycled my essence several times, trying to isolate whatever tainted my essence. </p><p>I had no idea what it was, but considering Volcano Essence failed to burn it, it wasn’t something simple. Luckily, freezing it with Snow essence before massaging the chunk of essence out was still viable. </p><p>Though, it was certainly expensive in terms of essence. Even with my advantages, dealing with it would be a challenge. </p><p>Still, knowing I wouldn’t fall victim to a mysterious curse was good news. I went out and found the man in the black uniform that assigned me the work earlier. “The maidservant of the Queen ordered me to work on the garden and fix the signboard. I need high-quality carving tools and gardening shears, sir,” I said. </p><p>“Unlucky bastard,” he said with a chuckle, not even bothering his glee. After all, the more time I spent in the garden, the faster I would die. He said nothing else. I took the tools and went back to the garden. </p><p>I had a lot of work to do. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It didn’t take long for them to arrive. A few minutes, barely enough for me to get used to the idea of cold-blooded murder. The Commander and the Wall-Breaker retreated, surrounded by a small army of henchmen, while the King Shadow followed, still surrounded by his attacks. </p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to calm my heartbeat even as I drew a gun, trying to aim. Observation helped with the aim, but not when my hands were trembling badly.  </p><p>As they approached, I tried to decide what to do. My initial objective was to shoot King Shadow first. With his rotating shadows creating a permanent defensive line, he was the hardest target, and I wanted to deal with him before things got too wild. </p><p>All of them were mass murderers, so I had no moral problems dealing with them, but apparently, my body was determined not to get that message. My palms grew sweaty, my heartbeat picked up, and no matter how much I tried to breathe, the air wasn’t enough. </p><p>I breathed.  </p><p>They got closer…</p><p>I breathed. </p><p>They got closer…</p><p>Feeling helpless, I overcharged my power. Already feeling the pain from the last time, the headache was blinding. Yet, I welcomed it. The pain, along with the sudden flow of extra information, was enough to distract me from what was about to do. </p><p>Pain was an excellent distraction.</p><p>I let out my breath, aimed for King Shadow, waiting for just when one of his shadows was near the Commander. </p><p>And, took a shot.  </p><p>It was not for nothing. Emily’s research showed that, whenever he was wounded, his control over his shadows weakened, which contributed to his reputation for collateral damage. Ordinarily, it wouldn’t have been too dangerous, but I timed it perfectly to one of his ‘close calls’, something that was only possible due to the practiced nature of their pattern, and my power. </p><p>The shadow exploded … sending the Commander flinging. He wasn’t dead, but the pain clearly distracted him. The sight of his panicking henchmen had been enough to confirm that. Their incredible courage and steady, practiced attack that would make special forces jealous was gone, replaced by panic as they started to spray King Shadow with their bullets. </p><p>Ironically, since they clearly didn’t know they weren’t actually enemies, they were even more dangerous. King Shadow created a few barriers in front of him, blocking the assault, but it left him open to an attack from high up. </p><p>Unfortunately, even in the chaos, they didn’t miss the fact that someone attacked from a window. They didn’t know from which, so they attacked all of them. King Shadow also looked up … and before he could register it, I took a shot. </p><p>Headshot. </p><p>I just killed someone, I realized with a chill, overwhelming my headache.</p><p>Ironically, the sight of many henchmen targeting the window I had just fired from was enough motivation not to linger on that.  </p><p>I ducked down, not wanting to get caught by a rain of bullets, and rushed up. I ignored the realization that I had just become a murderer, and rushed toward the stairs. “Follow me. Let’s kill him,” the Wall Breaker shouted, clearly unhappy with the death of his secret ally. I doubted the unaware henchmen shared his opinion, but they were too disoriented.</p><p>Escaping was the safest choice, but I noticed that the bullet storm stopped after his order, replaced by the sound of running. And, I didn’t want my bar to be attacked by a magically-coordinated team of henchmen, so I poked my head, aimed at the Commander, who was lying in the street, dazed, and took another shot. Hardly honorable, but I didn’t have that luxury when I was in the crosshairs of the biggest Hero Guild and a mysterious villain group at the same time. </p><p>Just like that, I was a double-murderer. </p><p>I stopped overcharging my power as I turned back and rushed toward the stairs. I climbed up as fast as I could, deliberately making a lot of noise. </p><p>The building was dangerous enough, and the faster they moved, the higher the chances of them stepping on something dangerous. The building wasn’t exactly the safest, after all. They rushed in rapidly, which would have surprised me if it wasn’t for two reasons.</p><p>With the Commander dead, his henchmen were still in a panicked daze as they followed the only other Villain … and the Wall Breaker was not famous for his strategic mind. He climbed the stairs up stupidly, confident that, in close distance, he could deal with a sniper. </p><p>I doubted he even realized I used a pistol. </p><p>Unfortunately, even as I climbed up, I could hear his footsteps getting closer, showing that he had some kind of super speed as well. Or, based on the loudness of his footsteps, he was using his strength to replicate super speed. </p><p>Not a good choice, as I could feel the building trembling. A beam fell, which I only caught thanks to my power, dodging in time. </p><p>I started firing down from the gaps on the floor blindly, hoping to delay him as I cursed my choice. I should have ambushed from an even higher floor. </p><p>I didn’t expect him to react in such a stupid way. A failure on my part. </p><p>I continued to run even as the henchmen responded, trying to shoot from his position. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t know the exact weak spots on the floor to allow the bullets to pass. I was confident that, if I was determined to ambush, I could deal with them as long as the building didn’t collapse. </p><p>But, with the Wall Breaker’s rough dashes breaking what little remained from the building, that was not certain. One glancing blow to a load-bearing column and…</p><p>“Perfect,” I suddenly gasped as I pulled off my coat hung it behind a load-bearing column, and left my gun in a way it would catch the sunlight. </p><p>The perfect red flag for a mindless bull. Then, I stopped firing as I climbed down the last few steps, and just like that, I was on the roof. </p><p>One benefit of arranging my escape path beforehand, I didn’t need to slow down even for a moment before I jumped to the next roof … then, half a dozen more before I climbed down a concealed fire escape. </p><p>Halfway down, a loud crush reached my ear, followed by a huge plume of dust. The building collapsed. It looked like my primitive trap worked even better than I expected, not only getting rid of the Wall Breaker but also getting rid of all evidence of the process, turning what happened into a mystery. </p><p>Hopefully. </p><p>It also added to the indirect count of the deaths I was responsible for, but that, I ignored, instead focusing on the more immediate problems, like getting away from the crime scene as much as possible while avoiding all cameras. </p><p>Luckily, the resulting dust cloud helped me quite a bit as well. Once I was five minutes away, I slipped into a  public bathroom, changed my clothes, bagged the old ones, and cleaned the grime off my face. Then, I moved away, joining the civilians that was getting away from the dust cloud. </p><p>There wasn’t much panic as the civilians evacuated. At this point, getting away from the collateral damage was a common habit. </p><p>I still made a point of stealing occasional coats and accessories to confuse a potential tracker even further before I took a bus … and arrived back at the bar, once again using the secret tunnel. </p><p>“Everything alright, sir?” Tara asked as she arrived. </p><p>“Nothing much, I just overused my power,” I said even as I stumbled to upstairs. “Make sure to wake me up when it’s time to open the bar.” </p><p>“Sir, you don’t look —” she started. </p><p>“No, it’s important,” I cut her off, not in the mood to explain to her. It was a bit rude, but I was not in the mood to explain her nonetheless. </p><p>I threw myself to the bed, hoping the sleep would come. </p><p>It didn’t. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I woke up, the first thing I did was text Emily. I spent a long time flirting with her, but as much as the pictures I received in response were beautiful, they were not my primary objective. Instead, I spent half an hour, slowly putting several leading questions until she offered to compile profiles for every hero and villain active in the city. </p><p>I wanted her to offer, as I didn’t want her to realize just how desperately I needed her help. I appreciated her assistance, but no need to give her an overinflated sense of ego. </p><p>The other benefit of asking for a larger dossier was to hide my findings. While I hoped that our communication would stay secret, there was no absolute guarantee about that. And, I much preferred if the enemy didn’t realize that I had already discovered the most likely lineup that would target me. </p><p>However, the names were enough to send me a chill through me. None of those villains were famous for their kind treatment of civilians, and each of them had dozens of confirmed kills — though, once again, someone needed to dig deep to discover it. The news made a point not to focus on that aspect. </p><p>Even King Shadow, the only hero among them, was not any less dangerous. He had killed many henchmen in his ‘heroic’ activities, but with his careless attacks, at least a portion of them had to be hapless civilians who were labeled as such after the fact. </p><p>After all, it was easier to blame a dead man living in the slums than a vindictive hero who could literally get away with murder. </p><p>Once that was done, I stood up with a grunt. My headache was still there, proving that I had overcharged it too much. Not for vain, certainly, but still too much. However, the sight of Tara, cleaning the place in a sexy maid uniform, went a long way to make the situation more enjoyable. </p><p>It was easier to think with such a beautiful eye candy providing a distraction from pain. As the dossiers started to arrive — once again with a shocking speed — I started checking the usual details about their distribution. </p><p>Their powers, their usual operation schemes, or even the speed of their activities. At the same time, I had set up some alerts to inform me whenever there was some news about their fights. </p><p>At the same time, I was trying to decide on one very important activity. Should I trust the effectiveness of the laser cannon and stay on the defensive, or should I act more aggressively? In most aspects, being on the defensive sounded nice. I knew the neighborhood, I had the weaponry needed to deal with them … and, most importantly, I could always run away if necessary. </p><p>Unfortunately, that also meant that I would have no chance of hiding the link between me and the results. Even if not all of them attack, two against four or something like that would be bad enough. Worse, one of them was a hero that was hard to take down without killing … and if I killed him, I would end up publicly known as a hero killer. </p><p>Not exactly a healthy title for a villain to have, even if the hero in question was a serial murderer. </p><p>Then, my phone rang. It was an alert. About a hero and villain battle. King Shadow versus Wall-breaker. It wasn’t too close to our bar, certainly not walking distance, but not too far away either. Pretty suspicious timing.  </p><p>“I’ll be out for a while. But, I want you to change and be ready to evacuate or defend the bar as needed,” I ordered Tara. </p><p>“If you say so, sir,” she said, but she sounded stressed. Her voice had a distinct edge that she got whenever she was nervous. It unsettled me. I must have been more open than I intended for her to pick on my stress. </p><p>“Just a precaution, but in case you need it, the laser cannon is at the office. Don’t be afraid of using it for an emergency.” </p><p>“Aren’t you going to take it with you, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“No, it’s too heavy. I can’t bring it with me and still be there on time,” I said, trying to sound calm and collected. “Also, it’s just a scouting trip. I don’t expect anything to happen.” </p><p>It was a lie, as I truly had no idea what would happen once I left the bar. I was walking into an unknown. I packed two guns, and two different sets of clothes that included masks, and left the bar through the secret tunnel, afraid of getting noticed. </p><p>However, there was one possibility that rankled me. The full realization that I might have to kill someone. The realization was like fingernails scraping on bones. It was not something I considered when I tried to bluff for my safety … but already, I was too deep. </p><p>I either took the chance to take down one or two enemies before they could react now, or I would have to do that once they attacked my bar. I didn’t have the luxury of taking multiple supers non-lethally even when prepared. If I tried to do that, it would end up horribly. </p><p>No, I had no option but to deal with them, at least in a way that would have given me plausible deniability. </p><p>It was why, once I got out of the tunnel, I stole a bike. Luckily, it was still a gang territory, and a lot of henchmen preferred bikes like I did due to the mobility advantages. </p><p>Once I did so, I put on one of the masks I prepared, and started driving. I avoided the main avenue and limited myself to the empty streets, still checking my phone as I did so. Wildly dangerous, but luckily, the battle was public enough that several news channels gave a real-time display. </p><p>However, just as I was approaching closer, I had to swerve dangerously. “Fucking heroes,” I growled in anger as I escaped death only thanks to my power, a huge rock flying where my head had been. I managed to stop and throw myself off the bike. I hid behind a car, and just in time for a shadow to explode, creating a rain of rocks. </p><p>The battle was happening on the other street, but he was careless enough to send a shadow here. No wonder King Shadow had such a high number of kills and turned loner … and no wonder he had a secret alliance with a bunch of villains, helping them to deal with the competition. </p><p>I didn’t approach the fight directly, but instead found a nice vantage point that I could watch the battle. </p><p>There were two sides to the battle. On one side, King Shadow stood alone, several walls made of shadows around him to block the bullets, while he continuously sent his shadows to attack his two enemies. </p><p>The Wall Breaker and the Commander — and his large group of henchmen — fighting against him. Two against one, yet King Shadow seemed to have the upper hand, steadily pushing the other two away. Occasionally, one or two henchmen died, but one thing the Commander didn’t lack, was disposable troops. </p><p>I had to admit, the battle was convincing. Without my previous research, I doubted that I would have caught the choreographed pattern of their battle even with the assistance from my power. They were too practiced, and the Commander’s unique ability to control his henchmen like they were puppets helped to disguise a lot of flaws. </p><p>No wonder they were pulling their scam for long.</p><p>I needed to deal with them now.  </p><p>I retreated carefully even after I came to that decision. I could see that the two were retreating steadily while King Shadow chased them, their direction was almost directly toward my bar. </p><p>Which gave me a chance to put an ambush. I dashed forward even as I tightened my grip on one of the guns, and found a nice spot. A ruined building, abandoned after a bad fire, but close enough to the next one so that I could jump to the other roof safely. </p><p>I went in, my observation helping me to navigate through the mess. First, I checked to see if I could actually climb to the roof. The last thing I needed was to get trapped. The building was a death trap, which worked well for my purposes. Every loose beam and weakened floor made the place more dangerous for the others. </p><p>Then, I waited, trying to prepare myself for cold cold-blooded murder I was about to commit…</p>",

    "content": "<p>Leaving Markas behind has been easy. Lord Eirto’s army retreated, the city lord’s forces were too busy to stay on the walls, creating a lot of gaps. I didn’t even stop by the hiding spot, leaving the Black Tiger Onslaught book buried for the moment. </p><p>I was still not comfortable practicing it, not after the last attempt left me with a lust for mortal combat. And, the other books weren’t particularly valuable. </p><p>Ultimately, I was planning to return once things calmed down. Part of that desire was certainly selfish. I still wanted the Volcano Hammer manuscript, and maybe a better-quality Snow Blossom one as well. </p><p>Traveling was much more comfortable now that I wasn’t afraid of dying of hunger or a sudden bandit attack. With my abilities, I was confident in dealing with anyone under the Bone Forging realm, and even they were not the impossible barrier that they had represented earlier. </p><p>Connate Realm martial artists would have been more challenging … but even a significant civil war had only one Connate Realm artist, so I didn’t expect to come across one while traveling. </p><p>Even with my luck, it seemed improbable. </p><p>“Now, to the capital,” I said. I didn’t even need to think much about my destination, not when the power of those cultivators was still on display. Despite my best efforts, I wasn’t able to learn much about the cultivators while I was in the city, other than cultivators lived for a long time, some of the weaker sects had some presence in the capital, and disrespecting them usually meant death because they were strong enough to get away with casual murder. </p><p>Only after watching their display over the city manor, I understood what passed as truly strong in this new world.  </p><p>Of course, technically, I could travel the kingdom altogether and try to find one of their sects, but the capital was a much better choice for that. </p><p>Ironically, Pearyin’s mission turned out to be redundant. I asked her to keep her true martial grade a secret, which would slow her down. So, with my unique movement art, I would move much faster. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the war, I would have searched for a trade caravan I could travel with, to see if I could multitask and get some benefits. But, under the circumstances, it was better to travel alone. I even avoided the main roads, which was not recommended. One reason was the lack of roads, which meant no horse or carriage to make the journey easy. </p><p>More importantly, the wilder areas meant a more dangerous fauna. Not just ordinary beasts, but savage beasts, which were to animals, what martial artists were to humans; faster, stronger, more durable. In a sense, they were even smarter. Not human smart, but still enough to make them troubling enough. </p><p>But, with my sprinting art, I was faster than most, allowing me to avoid them easily. Those beasts were valuable, enough to go for hundreds of gold. The money was tempting, as one could never have too much, but most huntersthat targeted the savage beasts operated in teams, which meant, a capable solo hunter would be remembered. </p><p>I traveled alone, not even bothering to use the begging trick. I had enough food in my Inventory, so there was no need to slow down for hunting.  </p><p>In a caravan, traveling between Markas and the Capital would have taken a month. For me, it took about three days, though only because I was able to use my newfound massage talent to manage the strain on my muscles. </p><p>An unexpected benefit. </p><p>Entering the capital was even easier than entering Markas. Just pay a gold coin, and that was it. Once again, I found an inn, but unlike my presence at Markas, I didn’t do anything to catch people’s attention. </p><p>For once, as a border city, Markas’ population was relatively stable, meaning there weren’t a lot of travelers, so the arrival of a young scholar was an important social event … but even then, meeting Elsana and Lannayin had been mostly luck. </p><p>Repeating the same trick for the others wouldn’t be as beneficial in the capital. Attracting someone as rich and capable as Elsana wasn’t likely, and even if I did, the Returns I would receive would be the same as I could get in Markas. </p><p>I needed to find a better path. </p><p>Finding the recruitment spots of the sects had been easy, mostly because they were not secret, or easy to miss. They had their own compounds outside the capital, which only had some outer sect elders and disciples, yet they were second only to the palace itself in splendor.</p><p>Another sign of their importance. I didn’t know why they weren’t ruling the world directly, as everything I saw showed that they certainly had the strength to do it. But then, it was probably the same reason Soviet Russia and America didn’t invade the rest of the world during the Cold War. More about politics than sheer power. </p><p>Unfortunately, approaching those places was out of the question. According to the stories, they didn’t like uninvited visitors, and their punishment was not easy to recover from. </p><p>So, I turned my attention to the next best target. The palace. All I needed was to decide on the disguise. There were a lot of ways to enter the palace. There were periodical martial arts tournaments, allowing young and promising martial artists to join the palace guards. As long as the Martial Artist was young enough, peak Muscle Reinforcement was acceptable. </p><p>The periodical central exam was another option. Every season, the best and the brightest scholars visited the capital and competed to gain an official position. </p><p>Unfortunately, neither was a good fit for me. They weren’t stupid enough to put a newly hired martial artist in a sensitive position like the palace without years of loyal service. And, a scholar examination required proper identity. </p><p>I even explored joining as a servant, but that turned out to be even more difficult. Being hired as a servant was easy, especially with some martial talent, but being posted anywhere important was an impossibility. </p><p>Several days passed while I was poking for information, which also allowed me to learn more about the palace and the various factions, usually defined around many wives of the Emperor. </p><p>I might even assume it to be impossible if it wasn’t for one lucky gossip I caught when I was frequenting — well, infiltrating as a cook, putting Marana’s teachings to good use — one of the gambling dens popular with the city guard.  </p><p>They were in a private room, unaware that they had a listener. A listener that had drugged their drinks with something extra, which would loosen their lips more than some ordinary alcohol would by itself, making them even worse gossipy. </p><p>“ … I bet the Third Queen won’t last more than a year. That’s what happens when a mere Third Queen acts like Dowager-Queen just because she had a cultivator brother.”</p><p>My ears prickled at those words, shocked by the topic of discussion. The reason was simple. The Third Queen was supposed to be a mysterious bride that came from far away ten years ago, with next to no information about her, other than the fact that she existed.  </p><p>“I heard his brother died in a mystic land. Is that true?”  </p><p>“We don’t know. We just know that, a year ago, some disciples from her sect arrived and took every artifact in her possession. His Majesty was quick to get the message, and ordered her to move to the Cursed Palace.” </p><p>“Is Cursed Palace as bad as they say? I thought it was just a rumor,” another said. </p><p>“Of course. The longest-lasting servants managed to last only a week, and they only walked the outer path to leave some food. Why else would they keep it empty for years before sending her there. It’s a miracle she lasted that much.” </p><p>As I listened to their gossip, I started to smile. A Queen, left alone as punishment, with servants fighting each other to avoid a dangerous mission.</p><p>Was visiting a location called Cursed Palace the best idea? Certainly not. But trying to get in contact with the cultivation world as a mortal was not a simple affair.</p><p>*** </p><p>Arranging my admission to the palace as a servant was easy. They were already hiring a lot of servants every year. Considering the requirements, it wasn’t exactly a glorious job. And, annoying the wrong noble, or even overhearing the wrong thing could easily end up in death. </p><p>Setting up an escape path through the city —  by leaving piles of smoke bombs and fireworks in various places in case I had to escape — took longer than getting in as a servant. </p><p>Ordinarily, arranging my admission to a specific place would be difficult. Luckily, the Cursed Palace was not exactly an assignment servants were competing for, meaning the Steward was having trouble finding people. Getting assigned there was even easier. </p><p>A few bribes here, coupled with a forged letter — another benefit of Marana’s teachings — written by my non-existent noble enemy who wanted to deal with me through an accident, passed to one of the subordinates, ensured that I ended up dressed in a drab blue robe, waiting in a line, with no surprise about my ultimate destination.</p><p>Sometimes, Freeloading was hard work. </p>",

    "content": "<p>It was fascinating just how routine life could be when the city was going through a civil war. Another week passed without anything noteworthy. The siege stalled, and even under curfew, the city fell into a weird, comfortable monotony. </p><p>I woke up, I ate, I practiced. Marana always stopped by when she was going out, and I used the opportunity to get a quick lesson about Muscle Reinforcement Tiger Fist, which finally pushed it to Minor Immersion as well, far faster than I could do on my own. I managed to get a few more Calligraphy lessons, allowing me to reach Major Accomplishment. I even got some cooking classes, continuing our lessons from Dumassa. </p><p>To maintain variety, I practiced the other martial arts as well whenever Marana was out, which allowed me to push them to Minor Immersion as well, each success making the next easier. Unfortunately, no matter how much I tried, I failed to do the same for Forest Dance or my unnamed sprinting techniques.</p><p>Something was lacking, preventing them from taking that step forward. </p><p>It was a small setback, but I didn’t care much. Not when I achieved my biggest objective after last night’s session. </p><p>The real benefit was the Essence Massage technique, finally reaching Minor Immersion after last night’s massage. I was yet to test its benefits, but I was rather enthusiastic about the potential improvements. </p><p>A rather important benefit. In a way, massage skill proved to be a surprising strategic asset, as raising people’s martial cultivation rapidly was valuable enough that, if I ever revealed it, the city lord — maybe even the king —  would have recruited me forcefully. Also, as the campaign against Tiger Fist showed, ruining people’s cultivation was far more effective as a weapon of terror than actually killing them. </p><p> Of course, neither really compared to its real advantage. It helped me to keep my lady friends happy and pampered, which, in turn, kept the rewards coming. </p><p>And, the ability to improve their cultivation was certainly a benefit. </p><p>Meanwhile, Crane Kick School had gone through an incredible burst of improvement. Marana had been training her disciples aggressively during that period, which put the pills she had received to good use. I had taken a few glimpses of their disciples fighting against Demon Claw disciples, taking them down aggressively. </p><p>Tiger Fist members were still in their compound. Unexpectedly, the Dragon Saber compound was empty. It seemed that they decided to pull back. I didn’t know why, nor did I care. Ultimately, it was not my fight. I just intervened to keep a few people I cared about safe. </p><p>Marana’s hospitality and attention were an excellent bonus, though.  </p><p>It was an ideal, easy life. A little more isolated for my tastes, but getting better was worth it. </p><p>This was why, when a sudden explosion rocked the city, I felt frustration along with fear. Such an explosion was never good news. </p><p>I dashed through the tunnel to get out, curious what I would find. </p><p>The source of the explosion was even easier to find. A robed man, floating above the city manor, his hand glowing red. A second after I saw him, he slammed his hand against the glowing protective dome, and another quake rocked the city, the shockwave wounding many and killing some. </p><p>Power…</p><p>No wonder people treated cultivators as gods and demons. I had a good idea about the limits of a martial artist. Even hundreds of them wouldn’t be enough to deal with that man, not when the aftershocks of his punches were enough to cause mayhem. </p><p>I didn’t try to go and intervene. I wasn’t suicidal. I didn’t even run away, afraid of somehow getting his attention. </p><p>I had no idea what he was capable of. </p><p>I shivered in fear as he hit the barrier again and again, each hit adding more cracks. Yet, before he could complete it, another figure appeared in front of him. A woman, wearing a veil and a thick robe, with her sword out. It was a familiar sight, but I had no idea if she was the one responsible for my unusual greeting, or just belonged to the same group. </p><p>“Stop. Kartpa Valley has no right to be here, attacking civilians,” she said. Her voice was familiar. She was the one responsible for my unusual greeting. </p><p>She didn’t shout, yet I was able to hear her. And, from the hopeful expression of the people around me, I wasn’t the only one who could hear her. </p><p>“Nonsense. I’m not attacking civilians. I just found this formation an eyesore, and I wanted to remove it. After all, it’s a cultivation artifact, and an eyesore,” he said, his voice hitting harder. A lot of civilians around me fell down in pain. I copied them. He paused for a moment, then continued. “Don’t tell me that you’re going to fight me over it. A mere inner disciple, daring to challenge an elder.” </p><p>When she swung her sword, I felt the touch of death. I didn’t know who would win, but from what I had seen, the odds of the city surviving were minimal. </p><p>I let out a breath when, rather than hitting him, however, the sword hit against the barrier, enough to shatter it completely. “Here, the eyesore is gone,” she said. Whatever she did, it left her exhausted. </p><p>“Clever,” the man said, then looked down toward Lord Eirto’s army — which had pulled back to avoid the shockwaves — before speaking again. “Don’t disappoint me.”  </p><p>With that, he disappeared. </p><p>I didn’t know exactly why he pulled back, nor did I care much. All I saw was a power that would have killed me if I had been in the wrong place. Everything I saw showed that he had the ability to destroy the city easily, held back by some kind of treaty. </p><p>Not a comforting thought. </p><p>The woman looked at the city for a moment, then disappeared as well. “Attack!” Lord Eirto shouted. </p><p>With his order, the army moved. From a closer vantage point, I heard Marana shout as well. “Attack!” The Wolf Fang and Demon Claw schools crashed against each other, while Tiger Fist members abandoned their earlier reticence and rushed out. </p><p>I stayed away. I wasn’t weak, but also I wasn’t strong enough to make a real difference. More importantly, I had no idea whether those cultivators were still nearby.</p><p>I couldn’t afford that female cultivator to notice my incredible improvement. Nothing good would come out of it. </p><p>Luckily, everything I had done until this moment had been enough. Crane Kick disciples were able to stand their ground against Tiger Fist disciples, especially when eight Instructors of the Tiger Fist school surrounded Marana, trying to take her down first. Three of those Instructors were at the Bone Forging realm, probably reinforcements that arrived during the week. </p><p>Crane Kick instructors tried to help her, but even with their recent losses Tiger Fist was numerous enough to keep them back. I might have been tempted to intervene if I thought that Marana was under any threat, but even when she was surrounded, she never displayed anything above the Bone Forging Realm  — which was still enough to shatter stone and steel casually. </p><p>Then, the moment they surrounded her, a subtle glow covered her. Her essence bubbled to the surface as she empowered her whole body at the same time. The biggest advantage of the Connate realm. Her attributes increased, her kicks hitting with a power that would put a tank to shame. </p><p>“Connate Realm. Escape —” one of the Bone Forging realm artists shouted, but it was the last thing he was able to say. The eight instructors tried to pull back, but none succeeded. I had to admit that Marana had planned that well. If they knew about her breakthrough, they could probably come up with a way to keep her in check, like spreading and forcing her to chase them, attack her disciples, or many others. </p><p>Their lack of information proved costly. </p><p>I climbed to a roof, watching as the blood covered the streets. Once she dealt with the Instructors, Marana didn’t waste any time with the panicking disciples. She rushed toward the manor, hitting the army from behind. </p><p>The following battle hadn’t been easy or quick, yet it was decisive. A Connate Realm Martial artist might be nothing compared to the earlier cultivators, but against anyone else, she was an unbeatable paragon. She moved along the army, cutting through a path toward Lord Eirto. </p><p>Which, in turn, forced the experts in his army to pull back and defend him, once again proving that quantity had a quality of its own. </p><p>Yet, the sudden shift was enough to turn almost a certain victory into a devastating loss. Lord Eirto and his forces started to pull back. The battle was over … but killing was not.   </p><p>I returned to my room, but only to write a note that looked like it was from the mysterious evil apothecary — the Calligraphy already coming useful — that Arthanum had been taken away momentarily, but would be sent back soon to act as a courier. </p><p>And, with my excuse for an eventual return in place, I left the city. </p><p>A civil war was one thing, but the presence of the cultivators was a deal breaker. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t try to find Marana when I returned. Instead, I immediately went to sleep, finally relaxing since the traitor servant of Elsana tried to drug me.</p><p>Elsana and Lannayin were safe under the barrier, and Marana didn’t need any help after her breakthrough. With Pearyin gone, I didn’t have anyone I actually cared about in the city who still needed my help.  </p><p>Technically, I still had the medicine workshop I set up in the rental house, but I wasn’t planning to return there. With most valuable herbs and other material already used for the pills I had given to Pearyin and Marana, the remaining stuff wasn’t particularly valuable. </p><p>Worse, I had made a great number of enemies while disguised as a crazy apothecary. The benefits of a few extra pills weren’t really worth getting caught red-handed. Abandoning that identity for the moment was the easier option.  </p><p>Especially when it meant I was hidden from probing, protected by Connate Realm martial artists with a soft spot for me, and willing to teach me, partially due to guilt she felt for putting me in distress. </p><p>And, I had no problem milking that guilt until she decided to kick me out. </p><p>Since the room was underground, I didn’t immediately know the time when I woke up. But, I woke up refreshed, so I expected it to be late afternoon at a minimum. There was some porridge in the room, waiting for me. It was cold and tasteless, but also rich in essence and easy to digest, likely some kind of emergency ration.  </p><p>“Now, what to do,” I said as I looked around the room, trying to decide what to do. My options were between improving my current skills and gaining new ones. </p><p>If it wasn’t for my massage abilities surpassing the limits and reaching a new realm, I would have probably chosen the latter, trying to expand my abilities. Yet, the benefits of the Minor Immersion stage when it came to massage had been an eye-opener. </p><p>The realms of expertise for various skills were a common topic in the books, as well as how to distinguish them. Yet, none of them mentioned anything above the Perfection realm. Whether it was impossible to bypass them without the assistance of the System, or I didn’t have valuable enough books to explain that was a mystery. </p><p>“Why not some experimentation?” I said to myself as I closed my eyes, focused on the Initiate Realm punches of Tiger Fist, and started practicing with renewed intensity. Ultimately, it was the best target to experiment. My enhanced martial ability allowed me to progress through those skills with extreme speed, and Initiate punches were the easiest to comprehend.  </p><p>And, as a bonus, since Marana was the one who gave me the book, I could always ask her some questions about using the System boost if I couldn’t break through by sheer effort. </p><p>I closed my eyes, imagining the full set of punches, not just the physical movement, but the conceptual weight behind it as well. The roar of a tiger, wild and untamed… </p><p>And, I lost myself in the practice. </p><p>All things considered, it was not bad. I had never been a habitual hard worker. I had worked hard for my sprinting career, but that was only because, at that time, I thought it to be my best option in life. </p><p>However, that didn’t mean I didn’t enjoy pushing myself physically. The real challenge was doing it all day , every day, endlessly. Luckily, my enhanced talent meant that results wouldn’t take that long. </p><p>I punched again and again, feeling the way my essence moved in my body acutely as I tried to push myself, focusing on perfecting every single muscle to perfection… As I focused inward, I could feel my muscles expanding, my acupunctures getting stronger bit by bit, the speed of change increasing… </p><p>The only problem, even Initiate punches burned a lot of essence, forcing me to stop for a break every half an hour, consuming another dish from my Inventory to keep me going. Yet, I persevered until, suddenly, my punches got much better. It wasn’t a gradual process, but a sudden jump, like I had touched something bigger than me. </p><p>The multicolored glow that surrounded me went a long way to convince me that it was not an illusion. </p><p>“Fascinating,” I muttered as I basked in the feeling, the concepts of the Tiger Fist getting even more clear in my mind, the poems that described the punches gaining meanings that I never even considered. Even without sparring, I knew that my combat capabilities had expanded considerably, along with my physique. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t repeat the same task with Muscle Reinforcement punches. My previous practice sessions showed that Muscle Reinforcement realm punches were much harder to learn and optimize even with my talent, meaning, I had to practice for days at a minimum, maybe even weeks, to actually gain the same benefit. </p><p>Even before my Inventory had been depleted by my recent adventures, I didn’t have enough food and essence pills for such a huge consumption. </p><p>And, that was with my enhanced martial talent. No wonder the books didn’t mention Immersion Realm, and mentioned Perfection as an impossible ideal. It was prohibitively expensive to reach that level … at least around Markas. </p><p>“I’m so glad that I could cheat,” I said as I went to the attached bathroom and had a quick wash with cold water. Without a servant, I had to prepare it myself. Dumping a bucket of cold water was much easier, especially since I could use Volcano Essence to counter the chill. </p><p>A little trick I discovered while sharing Elsana’s bed. </p><p>Once I got rid of the sweat, I returned to the practice area, and, without anything to do, I started practicing the other four arts to Initiate realm — though this time, without putting my full focus, afraid of getting caught. </p><p>Unlike Tiger Fist, they would have been harder to explain. </p><p>Unfortunately, even after spending three hours practicing Wolf Fang style, I failed to reach that level. It looked like a deeper immersion was a requirement. Then, I had to stop, because I heard the opening of a door.  </p><p>I didn’t stop practicing completely, as I was drenched in sweat. Instead, I switched to Tiger Fist, and started practicing Initiate punches, but kept my expertise level at the Beginner stage. After my breakthrough, faking incompetence got even easier. </p><p>I acted like I didn’t notice her arrival, and continued repeating the punches, keeping the Intent weak and hollow, still trying to convince her that I had been ruined by my forceful breakthrough. </p><p>I had been planning to play on her pity, but from the corner of my gaze, I noticed something else. The predatory gaze of an older woman who had been deprived of the pleasures of the flesh for a long time. I was far too experienced in seeking that expression to be mistaken.  </p><p>She watched me for a long time, so between my punches, I did my best to put on a show. </p><p>She interrupted me, but only after watching me for ten minutes. “You’re still practicing Initiate punches. Why?” </p><p>“Even a rotten tree can recover with stronger roots,” I answered, once again playing the scholar identity, but I made sure to sound exhausted. Though, I had to give her credit. Now that I was facing her, she was almost impassive. I could only catch a glimmer of interest behind her serious expression. </p><p>She didn’t rise to prominence to the point of opening a formidable independent martial arts school by being incompetent. I was able to trick her several times, but only because I operated under different — and frankly, rather ridiculous — rules, making it impossible to predict. </p><p>“Very good. This is only a temporary problem. Once you overcome it, you’ll get even stronger,” she said, though I doubted that she actually believed it. </p><p>Still, I appreciated the attempt to cheer up. “How’s the war effort?” I asked, changing the topic. </p><p>“Nothing to worry about,” she said. “With Tiger Fist pulled back to their compound, and Dragon Saber not willing to commit fully, the rebellion is floundering.” Then, she smirked viciously. “I will have a surprise for them soon enough.”</p><p>We chatted a bit more, but I was already busy thinking about which skill to ask her for help with. Martial arts was the easiest option, but with my talent, I could decipher the earlier realms eventually, while I couldn’t ask her help for the later realms without making her suspicious. </p><p>Calligraphy was tempting, as her lessons were incredibly helpful, but trying to convince her to help me was a difficult proposition. </p><p>Which left the most dangerous, and the most fun option. “It must have been stressful and exhausting, doing all of it. Do you want another massage?” I offered. After all,  her explanation made it clear that the siege would end in a few days, and I would have preferred if she had a reason to keep me around. </p><p>She looked surprised at my offer, so I kept my expression innocent and eager like I had no idea about her interest. “Why not?” she said.</p><p>Her tone was calm and collected as I massaged her, which didn’t surprise me. After all, she wasn’t Pearyin, inexperienced and timid. She was a beautiful woman who had just had a breakthrough to the Connate realm,  which probably made her the strongest martial artist in hundreds of miles.  </p><p>I certainly didn’t dare to pull any tricks during the massage, keeping it strictly professional. </p><p>Even without fun, the rewards were worth it. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pampering Bonus Bonus - 85 (Capped)]</p><p>[145x Return - Essence Massage, Perfection]</p>",

    "content": "<p>I took the Black Tiger Onslaught book with me, but I wasn’t paying attention to that as I walked through the tunnel. Instead, I triggered the rewards I had received. I started with Calligraphy and Essence Massage first, both at the Perfection stage, knowing that it wouldn’t do any harm. </p><p>Only after that information settled, I triggered the next blast of information. The knowledge of how to massage people better flooded my mind. Even as the information infused into my mind, I realized the only reason I was able to reach that level was my extensive knowledge as an apothecary, as well as many types of skills. Minor Immersion was a result of their merging, with the System-provided knowledge connecting the dots. </p><p>I would have pondered on that more, but something else caught my attention. </p><p>Suddenly, there was a glow around me. It was a multicolored array, gentle as it surrounded me, somehow giving a refreshing, calm feeling. It was fascinating, but I was more occupied by the fact that I did it while I was in an enclosed space. </p><p>It was hardly subtle. </p><p>I stayed in the tunnel until I was sure that the effects were completely gone before. And, once I left, I first visited the house. Pearyin was practicing diligently, so I didn’t disturb her. Instead, I dropped the book into a hidden spot before I started moving around the city.</p><p>I wanted to understand the changes.  </p><p>Contrary to my expectations, the number of soldiers defending the walls had been reduced. Escaping the city was possible. And, if it wasn’t for the great returns I received from Marana, I might have actually considered it. </p><p>Instead, I moved around the city, taking note of the changes. Patrols had been reduced even further, and the ones that continued, kept on the main roads. I wondered if Marana took a few groups without revealing herself as well, putting her new cultivation to good use while scaring them even further. </p><p>If she did, she clearly kept focusing on Tiger Fist, as Demon Claw disciples were still helping the city guards patrol while keeping the Wolf Fang and Crane Kick schools under siege. </p><p>The arena was empty and mostly charred. Since I merely used two firebombs, so they could have extinguished it easily, if they responded on time. </p><p>In their defense, I gave them more important things to be worried about. </p><p>The bulk of the army had been gathered around the city lord’s manor, but that increase only made them more desperate. During my absence, they had set up several siege weapons, throwing huge rocks toward the manor, but none of them managed to trigger anything bigger than a ripple around the manor. </p><p>Since neither Marana nor the defenders reacted to them, I assumed them to be harmless and left them behind. Instead, I decided to return to Crane Kick School. I had stayed away long enough. I didn’t want my absence to look suspicious if Marana woke up early. </p><p>I had no idea how long it would take. </p><p>Either way, before going back, I still made sure to walk around the Tiger Fist compound, and took down a few disciples that were away from the compound without killing — despite a flash of annoyance I felt, showing the effects weren’t gone completely — and threw a bunch more smoke bombs from a great distance to make them panic. </p><p>It was better to keep them panicking. </p><p>Though, that was all I was able to do, because the moment I threw the bombs, three instructors rushed out, two at the Peak of Skin Refinement, and one at Bone Forging Realm. </p><p>I moved away. It was not a force I could face without making some sacrifices I wasn’t willing to make. However, their response scared me a bit. Our hideout was nice, but by using the place to refine so many pills, I turned it into a dangerous place. </p><p>Maybe it was time to move away. </p><p>I returned to my hidden apothecary. “Hi, sweetie, new plan,” I called, interrupting her practice.</p><p>“Yes, Master,” she said enthusiastically. It was understandable, as not only she had improved greatly, but also she was still enjoying the high of our successful operation. </p><p>“You’re going to leave the town. Things are getting a bit too complicated, and I don’t want you to get caught in the crossfire,” I said. I had pushed my luck too much recently, and while I was confident that I could escape, I didn’t have the ability to save her if someone discovered her location. </p><p>“What about you, Master?” she said, worried. She looked nervous. </p><p>“Well, I’m going to stay for a while more,” I said. “Now, we have two options,” I said. “First, I’ll give you enough pills to bring you to the peak of the Skin Refinement realm, and you will be free to do whatever you want. Or…”</p><p>“I chose to stay with you,” she cut in immediately. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, amused by her enthusiasm. “But it might be risky.” </p><p>“I’m willing to take that risk,” she said, still star-struck. </p><p>“Very well, follow me,” I said. As I started the fire once more, I started explaining to her my plan. “You’re going to travel to the capital, and open a store selling low-grade martial pills,” I said, giving her a range of products. Which turned into a short lesson in pill refinement, mostly how to determine the quality of the products and other details. “Slowly sell them to fund your stay there, but otherwise do nothing to show off.” </p><p>She looked confused at the suggestion, but she didn’t question it. “Meanwhile, I want you to listen to the gossip of the capital. When I arrive, I want you to give me the breakdown of the city. The more complete, the better,” I said. “If anyone asks for the name of the owner, say that it’s Apothecary Bartna, and he will arrive in a few weeks,” I said. “Also, use the time to learn how to read.” </p><p>It should be enough to allow me to move to the capital without making too much noise. Staying in Markas was out of the question after everything. I just wanted to stay a while more. And, once I arrived at the Capital, I didn’t want to go around poking secrets. </p><p>Gathering those secrets passively should be much safer. </p><p>Once the pills were refined and bottled, I packed the place, including the book, but left the cauldron behind. Since I was leaving the city to escort her out, I didn’t want to risk it. “But, before leaving, let’s make sure you are strong enough,” I said. </p><p>“I … are you sure, Master. I’m in the Skin Refinement realm. It’s strong enough already.” </p><p>“There’s no point not using all the advantages,” I said. “Lay down.” </p><p>She did, and I started massaging her once more. However, I didn’t apply the Essence massage, but kept myself limited to the ordinary one, more to test the difference than actually expecting it to help in any manner. </p><p>Yet, the difference was even more overwhelming than I expected. I had been expecting no benefit considering her cultivation, yet, as my hands danced over her body, every flaw of her body became clear under my touch. Blocked veins from the impurities, weak muscles, and blood flow issues. </p><p>None of those issues were dangerous, or even important when treated in isolation, yet together, they limited her potential significantly. </p><p>Yet, as I applied my new massage techniques, those issues started to recover one by one, slowly correcting. It wasn’t instant, or even the majority of them were gone. It probably required months of massaging to see actual improvement … yet still fascinating. </p><p>After all, it was supposed to be just an ordinary massage to relax her body. It showed that going above Perfection was even more beneficial than I expected. </p><p>Unfortunately, rather than experimenting more, I switched to Essence Massage. I still needed to improve her cultivation, and we didn’t have the time to waste. While I used the massage and acupuncture treatment to enhance her cultivation further, I talked nonstop, giving her all the things she needed to be careful revealing. </p><p>Ideally, unless forced, she should disguise herself as a Muscle Reinforcement Martial artist, and try to keep a low profile. </p><p>Two hours — and a significant portion of the pills I had in my Inventory — later, she had reached the Advanced Skin Refinement realm, which, even with her subpar combat capabilities, would be more than enough to enable her security. </p><p>After all, Skin Refinement was enough to be the strongest person in a town or a major player in a city. As long as she was careful, she wouldn’t come to any harm. </p><p>Compared to her massage, getting out of the city was even easier. With the number of guards lowered significantly, there was no possibility of stopping a martial artist, so the guards didn’t even try. </p><p>I doubted that we were the only ones leaving the city. </p><p>“I think we have discussed everything,” I said as I escorted her away from the city, to the forest where I had hidden the Tiger Fist book. </p><p>She looked at me with a sudden blush, no doubt about to ask a question she thought to be shameful, but her courage faltered. “Yes, we have,” she said instead. </p><p>“Take care,” I said as I leaned forward, and kissed her gently as I sent her away. She clearly wanted more … but also she was too afraid to ask. I would have loved to tease her about that, but I had already stayed away for too long. </p><p>And, I was afraid, if we started, we wouldn’t stop for a long while.  </p><p>“You too,” she whispered, and walked away. </p><p>Good, as it would give her a chance to consider what she actually wanted to do in life. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the risks, I pulled the new book from my inventory the moment I was sure Marana wouldn’t return for an emergency and positioned myself so that I wouldn’t be easily observed from outside.</p><p>Risky, but the temptation to browse the new martial arts that I had received as a result of that extreme return was too tempting. Especially with a war that was going on. It could prove decisive. With my martial talent, I expected it to be deciphered in an hour or so, then I could destroy the book. </p><p>It didn’t work that easily. </p><p>Four hours later, I barely managed to scratch the surface, and learned the full set of Initiate punches, and one Muscle Reinforcement technique. But, for both, my understanding was still on a surface level. </p><p>The difference was like basic algebra and advanced calculus. </p><p>It was hard to assess without direct comparison, but at most, I was scratching the surface of the Minor Familiarity for Initiate Realm, and for the Muscle Refinement punch, I was still firmly at the Beginner stage. </p><p>Considering how quick my talents turned things around, the slow learning speed was certainly shocking. Still, I was glad to take the risk of pulling the book. It gave me another chance to push things forward.  </p><p>Not to mention, it was potent. My punches hit harder, and my essence boiled with a sense of wild oppression, giving me a sense of superiority. I felt like an actual tiger as I delivered the punches. Raging and aggressive, yet patient enough to wait for the opportunity. I couldn’t wait until the blood of my enemies —</p><p>“Okay, timeout,” I muttered to myself as I stopped practicing, and hid the book behind one of the shelves temporarily. That last feeling, I didn’t like. I had been very conscious about killing due to the casual attitude of the locals, which forced me to reexamine my own stance again and again. </p><p>Suddenly changing it due to a punching routine was hardly normal. </p><p>Black Tiger Onslaught was far better compared to Tiger Fist and the other techniques I collected. I had no doubt that, even an ordinary practitioner of it could fight across major realms, which was an incredible achievement. </p><p>Yet, it seemed that the side effects were no joke. </p><p>Even now, my heart was thumping wildly and my hands were twitching like a drug addict, asking me to go find an enemy to sate my bloodlust. </p><p>I needed to calm down. I would have used the secret entrance and gone for a walk … but a civil war was hardly the ideal circumstance for that. </p><p>I started looking around the room, hoping to find something that could distract me. A book, a toy, anything not a weapon. Unfortunately, the room I was in was essentially a guest room that was not prepared for a guest. </p><p>Luckily, there was a small desk, and there, I found some paper and a brush, ideal for writing letters. </p><p>I decided to practice my writing. It was the calmest activity I could come up with under the circumstances. I used the papers to write some poems about sunshine, calm waves, spring gardens, and anything calm I could focus on, trying to imagine myself there. </p><p>It helped. An hour after I started, my wild heartbeat finally calmed down. It had been an unpleasant experience. </p><p>“Now, what to do with you,” I said as I looked at my writing. They looked like they were written by a bored six-year-old. </p><p>Calligraphy was something I desperately needed to practice. The language jade had given me the knowledge to write … but not the ability of it. I didn’t have the best handwriting, and trying to write those complicated letters with a brush was even harder. My martial talent didn’t help with writing, which made practicing torture as well. </p><p>Worse, culturally, the locals put a lot of importance on writing. And, with my fake identity as a homeless scholar, asking for help was difficult. Even with Elsana, I failed to swindle a lesson without blowing my whole cover. Pearyin might have helped, but she didn’t know how to read and write either.</p><p>I looked at the door thoughtfully, and then a smirk appeared on my face. Why not receive the help of my current hostess? </p><p>I ripped every single poem I had written, but dumped them on the floor. Then, I continued to add onto the pile, but toward the top, I made sure to leave the poems intact enough to show their complexity, contrasting with the horrible writing quality. </p><p>Then, once I prepared the scene, I turned my attention back to the Black Tiger Onslaught. This time, rather than practicing, I just pondered on the changes it had made in the essence. I was reluctant to practice it … but if I could learn how to focus Intent like that, I might empower the other martial abilities significantly. </p><p>Not only Forest Dance, but also Volcano Hammer and Snow Blossom.</p><p>When Marana finally returned, she found me sitting on the desk, the floor filled with terrible writing, and a desolate expression on my face. “What’s wrong?” she asked. </p><p>“M-my apologies. I just discovered another side effect of the pills and lost my composure. It won’t happen again,”  I said. </p><p>“Tell me,” she said, soft and understanding. I might have actually felt guilty if I hadn’t saved her life and helped her to make a very important breakthrough. </p><p>“I … I think I lost my ability to write,” I said. “Somehow, I lost all my coordination. I tried to practice, but it didn’t work. Years of practice, gone…” </p><p>“I’m sure it’s temporary —” she started. </p><p>“Can you help me with it,” I cut her off. “Maybe, if you help, it might be helpful,” I said. </p><p>Despite her exhaustion, she pulled a chair next to me, affected by my plight. Luckily, pills had much weirder side effects than just forgetting how to write. “Grab the brush,” she said. I did. “Loosen your fingers. You’re grabbing the brush too hard. It has to dance on the paper like the autumn wind…” </p><p>With that, she gave me a detailed calligraphy lesson that lasted more than an hour, which was a great sacrifice under the circumstances. Also, it was a good sign that things somewhat calmed down outside. No matter how much Marana pitied me, she wouldn’t waste her time teaching me how to write if there was any risk of her disciples dying in the process. </p><p>Therefore, I didn’t even ask any questions about the war, and put my full focus on the lesson, knowing that, the more information she imparted, the better the final effect would be. </p><p>To my surprise, even before I triggered the System, my writing abilities increased significantly. My martial talent hadn’t improved the speed I could learn, but my cultivation still increased my flexibility as well as my memory. All she needed was to point out a mistake once, and I fixed it. </p><p>And, since my expanded language capabilities helped me with the mental aspects of writing, leaving only the practical details to worry about, my progress was already equal to someone requiring months. </p><p>“I think that’s enough,” Marana finally called it. “It’s clear that whatever harm his pills created, they are only temporary. You just need to practice more once things calm down,” she said, her tone making it clear that there would be no follow-up lesson. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pity Bonus - 30]</p><p>[90x Return - Calligraphy, Beginner - Minor Accomplishment]</p><p>Once I saw the return I managed to collect, I wasn’t particularly torn-up about her decision. Just like that, another major flaw was resolved successfully. I skipped the beginner and familiarity stages in just one lesson. </p><p>Incredible. </p><p>“Thank you,” I said, bowing slightly, then changed the topic. “You look tired.” </p><p>“Nothing to worry about. It was just a busy day,” she said. </p><p>“I can massage you. Elsana taught me some essence massage, and she told me that I was a natural. And, since it was helpful despite her incredible cultivation, I’m sure it’ll help you as well,” I said. </p><p>I could see that she wanted to refuse, but I wore my best earnest expression, and soon, she looked happy enough to accede to my wish. </p><p>I moved to her back and started massaging her neck and shoulders. My plan was to massage just for a few minutes, to give her a taste of my capabilities. After all, I had already reached perfection, and I didn’t need her feedback. </p><p>I just wanted to create an excuse for her to keep me near her, but I underestimated the stress she had been carrying. So, rather than using my essence massage abilities to the limit to help her with her cultivation — which would have been minimal — I focused on the ordinary aspects. </p><p>“Feel free to comment if you have any problem,” I said as I worked on her back. </p><p>At first, she didn’t say anything, no doubt expecting it to be no help with her current cultivation. To be fair, I didn’t expect too much, but the moment I started working on her back, I realized I had been underestimating the stress she was under. </p><p>My mistake. It took five minutes for her to bring me to another room and ask for a proper massage. </p><p>The boring kind, unfortunately, but she had quite a bit of small corrections nonetheless. She might not be an expert in massaging, but the cultivation difference helped her to catch a lot of details I missed, which made the massage far more effective.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no fun follow-up. “That’s enough,” she finally said. “Feel free to use the guest room to rest once you check if there’s any message,” she said. </p><p>She was already asleep before I left, not even bothering to go to her bed. I would have been annoyed at her dismissal, but the System rewards arrived, changing my mind.    </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pampering Bonus Bonus - 85 (Capped)]</p><p>[145x Return - Ordinary Massage, Perfection - Minor Immersion]</p><p>[145x Return - Essence Massage, Perfection]</p><p>Apparently, Perfection was not the limit for skills. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Considering everything that had happened, the city was surprisingly calm. Tiger Fist Members were already restless, as losing a great number of disciples and even an instructor after winning a war was unsettling enough. When their allies of convenience lost no one, it got even more painful. </p><p>Then, Marana appeared, strong enough to cut through the sieging forces through surprise factor to return to her compound, apparently already recovered. </p><p>Their shock at that fact showed that Marana’s reputation had been overwhelming before her injury. </p><p>The combination was enough for them to pull back to their compound, abandoning the siege; whether temporarily or permanently was to be seen. They even stopped surrounding the Crane compound, replaced by Demon Claw disciples, whose presence was predominantly Initiates with a few Muscle Reinforcement martial artists sprinkled in. </p><p>It was clearly just for the show while they tried to update their strategy.   </p><p>After making sure there would be no city-wide search for me in the short term, I returned to the safe house, after another short yet intense practice session with Pearyin, I refined pills nonstop. Mostly essence pills, some to ease the breakthroughs, and a few unique pills that would help wounded people recover from ordinary wounds in less than a day. </p><p>The quality of the pills wasn’t as high as I would have preferred under better circumstances, but they would still function well. </p><p>As I walked toward the meeting spot we agreed, I wore no disguise. Creating a disguise to trick someone in the dark of the night while a battle was going on was one thing, but tricking a Connate realm martial artist face to face in bright daylight was something else. It was not something I was willing to risk. </p><p>Talking to Marana without any disguise was a risk, but also an opportunity. </p><p>I arrived at the meeting location early, but found Marana waiting for me. “You—” I gasped, doing my best to look absolutely shocked. “M-Marana, what are you doing here?” I added, trying to look panicked. “Don’t tell me you got captured by that mad couple.” </p><p>It was a preemptive strike to show her that I was not aligned with the so-called old man. I could have said that I worked for ‘him’, but while that would keep me secure, I strongly doubted that it would trigger the System. </p><p>It would work much better if she believed me to be a victim of circumstances. </p><p>“Not exactly,” she said as she kicked the air, the sharp cutting sound that accompanied leaving no doubt that she was a martial artist. “I’m not a cook, but a member of Crane Kick school,” she said. Interestingly, she didn’t say she was the hall master. </p><p>“Y-you’re a martial artist as well. How fascinating —” I started, then, paused. “You were the one that gave me the book,” I said, looking star-struck. </p><p>“Yes. Now, tell me. What are you doing here …” she started, then paused, rightfully assuming that the previous name I had given her was a false one. </p><p>“Arthanum. My real name is Arthanum,” I said. </p><p>“Good. Now, explain,” she said, her voice sharp. She gave me nothing, which was a smart idea. It was far easier for me to trip while lying without extra details. </p><p>Unfortunately for her, I knew too much to be tripped by that. </p><p>“Once I got away from those disciples, I decided to move to the city, hoping to buy some pills that might help me. However, I was lucky to come across a few patrons on the road, who appreciated my poems enough to give me a little reward. So, when I arrived in the city, I put on a bit of a show, acting like my family still wanted me back, and I was just traveling. That way, no one would target me...” I said, then launched a long and detailed tale of my adventures. </p><p>I subtly highlighted that it was Elsana and Lannayin who came on their own accord to meet me rather than the reverse. It was easy to verify considering it was a fairly public event. </p><p>I didn’t want her to start suspecting that I was the agent of the ‘old man’, sent to infiltrate the compound. </p><p>“ … and, then. A servant helped the guards to capture me. But, before I arrived at my destination, a crazy old apothecary saved me. But, other than keeping me in a room, and feeding me a few pills to claim it’ll make me useful, he did nothing,” I said, finishing the tale, keeping an appropriate amount of confusion in my tone. </p><p>Luckily, I was practiced in that. In a way, it was like convincing my lady friends that the panties they discovered under my bed were a prank and I wasn’t cheating on them. </p><p>Only with higher stakes. </p><p>She asked a few more questions about my travel, to which I responded with mostly truth, but exaggerating the dangers I faced. I wanted her to feel responsible for my distress and pity me more. </p><p>“I see that you’re already in the Muscle Reinforcement stage,” Marana said, thoughtful, but I could see the pity in her eyes. Understandable, as forcibly improving cultivation meant my potential would be damaged. More importantly, facing the same level, I would always underperform, which was something the martial artists put great value on. </p><p>Duels often happened in people in the same cultivation level, and having such a disadvantage for them was a great dishonor. </p><p>In a way, it was Pearyin’s situation. I doubted that she could ever put up a fight against someone at her level … but considering just how high her cultivation had reached in just a few days, she wasn’t exactly in a place to complain. </p><p>Being the poorest millionaire in a country club was not the worst fate.  </p><p>“I … I am,” I said sadly, showing that I was aware of the consequences.  </p><p>“What are you going to do now?” she asked. “Are you going to return?” </p><p>“No. He said to check a hidden spot every day for messages to pay back that favor. Other than that, he said nothing,” I said, putting me on the same boat with her. I was hoping that she would invite me to go with her, which should be very beneficial to her current cultivation, </p><p>She looked thoughtful for a moment. “Alright, come with me,” she said. </p><p>I thought about refusing it first before reluctantly accepting, but the risk was too high. What if she gave me a job as an excuse? But, there was more than one path. “I … I better not,” I said. “He ordered me not to be too attention-catching. I’m afraid that…” </p><p>“Don’t worry, I still have some spots that you can stay hidden,” she said. </p><p>“Really, Marana?” I said. “You must have a high rank to do that,” I said, acting like I didn’t know her real position. </p><p>“You can say that,” she said. Then, to my surprise, she brought me to the outskirts of the city before entering an ordinary house, which had a small tunnel that led to the Crane compound. “Never reveal it to anyone,” she warned me. </p><p>“Never,” I said, then passed. “Where exactly are we?” I said as I looked around. </p><p>“We are in my private quarters. Don’t worry, no one can enter without my permission,” she said, which I appreciated. The trust she extended to me was a bit absurd, but from the gentle gaze she wore, I could see that she felt some kind of responsibility toward my current situation. </p><p>After all, she was the one that gave me the  </p><p>“Private quarters. But does that mean that you’re an instructor at Crane School? How amazing!” I said. “I never expected you to be that strong, Marana,” I said, baiting her to admit that she was actually the hall master. </p><p>“Something like that,” she said, once again ignoring it. “Now, show me how well you learned the book I have given you,” she said. </p><p>I paused for a moment, wondering just how much I should be able to show her. I could sandbag it completely to look useless, therefore guaranteeing her pity, or I could show potential, risking her to treat me more seriously. </p><p>Or, I thought suddenly, I could try a combination. “Tiger Fist,” I growled as I punched, showing perfect technical proficiency in the Initiate stage punches, but keeping my essence weak. More importantly, I used my medicinal knowledge to impede the essence flow. I would have shown Tiger Ascend, but that wasn’t included in the tattered book she had given to me. </p><p>I was hoping that she would give me another. I had already received a complete book from Elsana, which could have explained my improvement. But, I hoped to receive a better one from her. </p><p>And, hopefully, an even better one from the System. </p><p>I continued to display the Initiate Realm punches, showing great comprehension but limited power. Through the way I was showing, there was no hope for me to fight against a proper disciple. All because the ‘old man’ decided to feed me some pills to hasten my cultivation. </p><p>“Very good. Work hard, and you will make great progress,” she said. “Actually, wait a minute,” she said, disappearing for a moment. When she returned, she came with another old and tethered book. </p><p>The title alone marked it as a superior product. “Here, a gift for you. Study this, and you might see some improvement,” she said as she passed the book to me. “I need to go and distribute those pills now. Feel free to practice freely.” </p><p>“Thank you, Marana,” I said with a bow, happy with her gift. It was another Tiger Fist Manual, but it was far superior to the ones Elsana gave me.  </p><p>Which meant a higher return. But, the result still surprised me. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 60; Pity Bonus - 70 (Capped)]</p><p>[130x Return - Black Tiger Onslaught Martial Art, Complete, Yellow-High Grade]</p>",

With their teams split between sieging the Crane Kick school and surrounding the city lord’s manor, it was surprisingly empty. </p><p>Yet, I didn’t touch any of the Demon Claw teams. </p><p>The search was called off after the attack, with their forces pulling back. </p><p>I was curious about what it would do to their alliance, but I didn’t have the luxury of paying attention to that. Not when I met a more fascinating opportunity. </p><p>The number of the guards at the arena had been reduced. The Dragon Saber Instructor was gone. An unexpected benefit, but I needed to make it more convincing. I thought about changing my disguise but then decided against it. The mad old apothecary was a good disguise.</p><p>Then, I went to the arena, and threw another firebomb toward the stands. Then, I followed it with more than a dozen smoke bombs, making it look like the fires were far more intense. </p><p>“He’s here. He’s here to kill us all!” I shouted loudly, then changed my voice. “No! My cultivation!” I wasn’t exactly an expert in changing my voice, but moving in the smoke quickly allowed me to shout from different directions. </p><p>I burst forward and took down several more Muscle Reinforcement artists while they were panicking. Meanwhile, the two Skin Refinement instructors, one Tiger Fist and one Demon Claw, attacked without saying anything. </p><p>I dodged their attacks while I retreated back into the smoke, doing my best to look in distress, which wasn’t exactly wrong. Even with my talents, taking two martial artists of a higher realm was not an easy achievement while not using any discernible martial attacks. </p><p>Luckily, from the beginning, it was not the plan. At a distance, I could see several disciples dragging a chained Marana out of her cell, not willing to abandon her in her cell. I let them, while I let the two instructors push me into the smoke. </p><p>Then, I reached into my Inventory and pulled a poison. It was an improved version of some kind of knockout dust that Elsana gave me, though only effective against the Initiative realm. Creating poison that could affect higher-ranking artists was prohibitively expensive. </p><p>Unfortunately for my opponents, I had the System to improve them further. They were too late to react when I threw the dust on them. Even with the System upgrade, it wasn’t enough to take them down. </p><p>But, it was enough to make them panic as they retreated out. With the smoke blocking their sight, I easily escaped, using a predetermined escape path. </p><p>In the chaos of smoke bombs and panicking servants, catching up with the disciples who were escorting Marana was easy. Concealed, I prepared to attack … only to freeze when I eavesdropped on the disciples talking. </p><p>“Hurry up, we need to bring the Hall Master back to Tiger Palace,” one of them said. “Great Tiger would kill us if she gets free.”  </p><p>“Our Demon Hall is closer. Why don’t we go there?” replied a Demon Claw disciple. </p><p>“You would like that, wouldn’t you? No, we’ll go to Tiger Palace,” the first one responded, not bothering to hide his suspicion. </p><p>As much as I loved to hear the seeds of suspicion I had set up had been working excellently, my mind was preoccupied with their statement. </p><p>They referred to Marana as Hall Master. </p><p>I had already realized that she had been a high-ranking member of Crane Kick School, but Hall Master meant that she was the founder. Which was weird, as the System return indicated that she was not even at peak Skin Refinement. </p><p>I decided to resolve the mystery later. I threw another smoke bomb, and while the disciples were panicking, I started attacking Tiger Fist ones, ruining their cultivation before I grabbed Marana, temporarily immobilized her with a blast of essence, and brought her away before reinforcements could arrive. </p><p>Success. Now, I just needed to find a way to get her help with Elsana’s predicament, and everything would be perfect. </p><p>I returned to the previous safe house I had set, but deliberately kept it dark. “Now, let’s have a talk, Hall Master Marana,” I said with a whispery, evil voice that wouldn’t be amiss. She looked scared without her ability to move. </p><p>I didn’t enjoy scaring her, but it was better than the alternative. I grabbed her wrist, and used her pulse to diagnose her even as I allowed her to move once more. With my new medical knowledge, it took a second for me to understand the root of her problem. </p><p>Apparently, ruining people’s cultivation wasn’t as unique as I had first assumed. She was wounded badly, which clogged two of her gates, and damaged eight acupuncture points. It was a dangerous wound already, but not something Elsana couldn’t fix, even after it had reached the current point. </p><p>Right now, she was barely in the Intermediate Muscle Reinforcement realm, showing that she has regressed even lower than the time we first met. \\</p><p>“Who are you?” she asked</p><p>“Enemy of your enemy,” I said, my tone making it clear that I wouldn’t allow her more questions. “Interesting problem you have here. How about we make a deal for healing you,” I said. </p><p>I wanted to support her, but offering some kind of mysterious deal was less suspicious. </p><p>“What kind of deal?” she growled. </p><p>“Nothing much. I just want a copy of Volcano Hammer and Snow Blossom techniques,” I said. They never mentioned her by name, but Elsana and Lannayin had talked about owing to Crane Kick school. It was a good way to indirectly interrogate her. </p><p>“Never,” she said. </p><p>“Oh, just a copy. I’m sure they will be happy to pay for your recovery,” I said. Her expression looked tight. “How about if I throw some pills that can help your people recover from their wounds. The last time I looked at them, they were in a bad condition.” </p><p>This time, her expression flickered. “I … Even for that, I won’t force them,” she said. </p><p>Honorable, pointlessly so. She was lucky that I was just trying to make an excuse. “How about this? If they refuse, you’ll follow me for five years. A connate realm servant will be helpful, and you’re not a bad cook.”  </p><p>“Connate realm?” she said, shocked enough to temporarily ignore the jab about knowing where she was. </p><p>“Yes. You’re just at the edge. It’s not a difficult task for me to help you over,” I said, which was not true. It would be challenging. And, it was only possible because her injury didn’t destroy her essence, and just blocked its transmission instead. </p><p>Ironic that her injury turned out helpful. Unlike Pearyin, I didn’t need to feed her a lot of pills and help her absorb them, just repaired the channels, and moved the essence. </p><p>“Alright. But only after this crisis is over. I swear on heavens and on my honor,” she said. </p><p>“Good, there’s no love lost between me and those incompetent house cats,” I growled. “Actually, I’m even going to give you some pills free of charge. Just make sure those idiots learn their lesson,” I said. </p><p>“Now, prepare. It’s going to hurt,” I warned her. </p><p>I didn’t coddle her as I quickly stabbed needles to hundred and eight acupunctures, and at the same time, I started focusing on the blockages. My unique set of abilities once again proved useful. Elsana could have cured her, but the best she could do was to slowly bleed the excess essence. </p><p>I was familiar with Crane Kick enough to channel her essence correctly. I fed her a healing pill I refined, allowing her acupuncture points to recover while I helped her channel her essence correctly. Her cultivation started to rise. Peak Muscle Reinforcement, Peak Skin Refinement … Beginner Bone Reinforcement, Intermediate, Advanced, Peak…</p><p>“Now, prepare yourself,” I said as I popped an essence recovery pill into my mouth. It was a Yellow Medium-Grade pill, the best I had in my inventory. If I wasn’t desperately imbuing the needles to keep channeling the essence, it would have probably pushed me somewhere in the middle of the Skin Refinement realm without a problem. </p><p>Raising to Connate Realm was no joke, even under the perfect circumstances I had been facing. I bit my lips as I channeled her essence through a combination of massage and treatment. Under the effect, her acupuncture points started to extend, creating essence connections between her muscles, skin, and bones. </p><p>Just like that, all the benefits of the previous three stages melded together, turning into an overwhelming advantage. </p><p>I gathered my needles and pulled back while she gasped on the floor. Yet, despite the pain she was still feeling, she had an incredible smile on her face. </p><p>“As per our agreement, I’ll send the pills you need in a few hours. Try not to make too much commotion until I can send them,” I said. “Don’t forget, even a Connate realm martial artist can’t stand against an army.” </p><p>“How are you going to send the pills,” she asked.  </p><p>I described a location. “Be there just at midday. I’ll even use someone that’s precious to Elsana,” I said, making sure to give a cruel expression. “She can thank me for saving him.” </p><p>I could have used a dead drop, but I decided against it. After helping her to break through, it would be a pity not to get some System returns. </p><p>I had worked hard. It was time to freeload once more. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I had gone over Emily’s report a couple times, and my power allowed me to catch some combinations. Most were unrelated to Slasher’s adventures, but I still managed to identify two Villains with whom he collaborated… A low-level ranged attacker called the Buccaneer, who fashioned himself after pirates, and a regular thug, Wall-Breaker, with a minor invulnerability skill. </p><p>I had to admit, three of them made a strong team, disposable enough to be used against a mysterious villain, yet effective enough to deal with us. </p><p>Unfortunately, as I read the report, something in my mind niggled, telling me that I was missing something important. I didn’t know if was something about my power, or just my own paranoia — sometimes, it was hard to distinguish the two — but either way, I didn’t dare to ignore it further. </p><p>I overcharged my power as I started to go through the report, and the connections between discrete events thickened, but so did my headache. </p><p>“Everything alright, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“Just a headache,” I said, then I noticed her questioning glance, even though she didn’t dare to actually ask a question. “I know I can rest, but it’s too important,” I added. </p><p>“I understand, sir,” she said, but with my power in overdrive, I could see her intense worry. She clearly wanted to help but also knew that there was nothing she could do. It was a pity that I didn’t have a way for her to … </p><p>Then, it clicked. “Why don’t you come here, sweetie? I can use your help.” </p><p>“I’m ready, sir,” she said as she moved next to me. “What can I do?” </p><p>“You can start by getting rid of your top. I need a distraction from the headache,” I said. She blushed, not expecting the help to come in that form. Then, I patted the desk. “Get rid of the rest, and sit here. An eye candy would be helpful.” </p><p>She might be surprised by my request, but she was certainly not disappointed, following my request as I asked. She sat on the desk, her legs crossed with a whole body blush, creating a beautiful ornament for my viewing pleasure. </p><p>“Good, now, continue watching them,” I said as I gave her another set of combat footage, this time not just the Slasher, but the thug and the wannabe pirate as well. There was no harm in being prepared. </p><p>I returned to analyzing the reports, but one hand stayed on her body, the sensation of her supple skin just enough to take the blunt off my growing headache. I delved deeper and deeper into the reports, leaving me with a blinding headache … but it was not a waste. </p><p>I managed to identify some interesting connections between Slasher and two other Villains, and one independent hero. </p><p>One of the villains was the Underworld Archer, who, similar to the Buccaneer in terms of effectiveness. He had some kind of projection ability that he could only use to create a bow and various types of arrows, though whether he was skilled in targeting, or if it was a part of his skillset was unknown. </p><p>The other Villain was the Commander, who had some kind of coordination skill, able to use a dozen thugs he followed with impressive capability, limiting himself to bank heists, but his limited range was his major problem. </p><p>And, the sole independent hero I suspected was King Shadow, a mysterious man with the ability to form and control living shadows. He was famous for his excessive aggressiveness and environmental damage. The only thing that prevented him from being treated as a villain was his track record. He got results, taking down a lot of minor villains, so he was left alone. </p><p>On the surface, there was nothing that really linked all four together. They didn’t even face each other too many times, and if it wasn’t for my power, combined with the excessive detail level of Emily’s report, I would have never caught any link. </p><p>There were relatively few encounters between King Shadow and the other three, but a majority of them were followed by another heist a few days later in the same area, often using the environmental damage created by King Shadow to their benefit. </p><p>And, a few times, they used the fight as a distraction to hit a different location. A nasty combo that, even with my power, I wouldn’t have discovered if it wasn’t for my focus on Slasher. No wonder it stayed undiscovered. </p><p>Who would have spent that much energy on a minor villain? </p><p>Of course, that raised another interesting question. Who was the leader? I hadn’t interacted with any of them, but none of their public personas had shown them to be a planner to such a degree — including the  Commander, despite the name. </p><p>Either one of them was disciplined enough to constantly reflect a fake persona, or they had a supporter from the Shadows. Considering the lack of video evidence about the Slasher’s full abilities, I was inclined to believe the second. </p><p>As for who supposed them, I had no idea. Maybe the Syndicate, maybe the New Giant force … maybe someone completely different that let the two borrow them. </p><p>The more I delved, the more I started to realize that the world of heroes and villains wasn’t as simple as it first seemed. There was more going on than bright costumes and collateral damage. </p><p>And, by poor luck, I somehow ended up in the middle, already too late to pull back. </p><p>I needed to deal with the mess … but not right now, not with a blinding headache. I needed to relax, and I needed a nap. </p><p>With that sequence. </p><p>I didn’t say anything. I just unzipped my pants, and Tara slipped under my desk. </p><p>The headache didn’t prevent me from appreciating the view as her thick, brown hair flowed down to her shoulders, particularly when her eyes looked at my shaft, captivated with excitement. Her pouty lips parted invitingly as she leaned forward without hesitation, and soon, her warmth enveloped me.  </p><p>Unlike the previous times, she didn’t show any hesitation as she pushed herself down, her throat tight around my length. She pushed fast while I leaned back, enjoying the service passively. My head hurt too much to have any kind of active role. Even the temptation of her beautiful naked breasts wasn’t enough to distract me. </p><p>Her hands landed on my legs, and whenever she pulled back to catch her breath, they replaced her lips. “Give it a lick, sweetie,” I commented.  </p><p>She gasped as she leaned forward, the small comment enough to break her self-confident streak. Her enthusiasm was still there, of course, but with shyness back into the mix, she looked incredible. </p><p>Especially that shyness didn’t prevent her from treating mine like a delicious ice cream cone, her hands working on the base. “My god,” she whispered as her hands danced up and down, acting like it was the first time she had seen it. </p><p>Though, in a way, it was the first time she had such a free rein, playing on my length steadily. Her hands explored every inch of my length, her tongue working harder than her fingers. </p><p>“You can suck again,” I said, permitting her to start working on it once more. She withdrew her hands, but her lips once again replaced without the slightest delay. Her shy blush’s contrast with the skill she was going down was truly spectacular as she continued to kneel in front of me. </p><p>She looked mesmerized.</p><p>I sank deeper into my chair with a sigh, deliberately ignoring every single aspect of the incoming disaster — as thinking about how to handle various combinations of six super opponents activated my power, which was very painful — and enjoyed the service instead. </p><p>She continued providing said service, each second driving my pleasure further and further as her lips continued to dance, working hard to bring me to completion, moving faster and faster, plunging down deeper and deeper. </p><p>Ultimately, she succeeded, and I exploded. “Don’t waste it,” I ordered … and she was quick to follow that order, not wasting even a drop. </p><p>A fascinating victory… </p><p>“I think I’ll take a nap here, wake me up in two hours,” I said before I closed my eyes, the momentary euphoria silencing the pain and exhaustion enough to allow me to fall asleep. </p>",

    "content": "<p>When I successfully returned to the bar, I was thoroughly exhausted, especially since I didn’t want to leave the bar unattended any longer than necessary, and didn’t even dare to take a nap. I had too many enemies for that to be a good idea. </p><p>The exhaustion didn’t hurt my good mood. How could it, when I not only managed to convince a beautiful super to help me fix a laser cannon, but finally gave me a trump card I could use for emergencies … not to mention, the process of convincing her had been incredibly fun.  </p><p>Unfortunately, after I returned, I didn’t go upstairs, where my brunette bodyguard had been waiting for me to snuggle against her, but stayed downstairs. There were a lot of things to poke around. </p><p>First, I had to set up a proper charger for the laser cannon. While its internal capacitors had been intact, after Emily’s adjustments, the cannon barely had enough for a dozen low-powered shots or one full-powered shot. </p><p>And, it required a full day to refill, which was not something that could be solved as long as I relied on city electricity uninterrupted … which raised another problem. I was sure that, with their contacts, both the heroes and villains were observing various details. Expecting the electricity consumption not to be one of those details was absurd. </p><p>I couldn’t afford to just plug it and charge it completely. </p><p>A part of it was about keeping the benefit of surprise on our side. The next wave would have been much weaker if they were unaware that I turned that laser into something usable. However, if things went well, even after revealing it first, I wanted to keep that particular detail a secret longer, maybe even fashioning some kind of box with blinking green lights to look like a new reactor. </p><p>The more intimidating I looked, the safer I would be. </p><p>It was already morning when I managed to fashion some kind of home science project to regulate the power draw of the laser cannon even lower. Hopefully, it would be mistaken for a fridge or something. </p><p>Tara walked in, carrying a nice hardy breakfast. Eggs, bacon, and freshly squeezed orange juice. “You’re a lifesaver, sweetie,” I said as I kissed her. </p><p>“A pleasure, sir,” she said, her blush beautiful. “What are the plans for today.” </p><p>“Nothing much other than staying in and waiting for an attack,” I said. I didn’t want to ruin the mood, but I felt like a follow-up attack was inevitable. It was better for her to be prepared. </p><p>“Do you think the heroes would attack again?” she said. </p><p>“No, villains this time,” I replied. “The slasher is the most likely candidate, but he’s far from the only candidate.” </p><p>“Why?” she asked.  </p><p>“They don’t want to escalate,” I explained. “If they send a stronger hero immediately after their first one failed, other groups would start to pay attention here. And, while I had no idea what was going on in that depot, it’s clear that the last thing they want is scrutiny,” I said, then snorted.  That was an understatement. </p><p>Neither the Syndicate nor the New Giant Forces wanted that to get public. </p><p>“So, they will probably arrange for one of the independent villains to attack. Probably Slasher, maybe one of his allies to support,” I said.  </p><p>“Well, I can deal with the Slasher and another minor villain easily,” she answered, showing that she had started to feel confident after her victory. A mistake, which was why I interrupted her with a gentle slap at her hips. </p><p>“You’re getting arrogant,” I warned her. </p><p>She blushed immediately, her submissiveness far stronger than her budding arrogance. “I’m sorry sir,”  she said, accepting my conclusion immediately. </p><p>I looked at her, sighing. “Come here,” I said as I pulled her on my lap, and opened my phone. “Watch this,” I said, and played one of the many videos that Slasher had publicly. He was armed with a blade, wore a mask, and with every swing, a fifty-foot energy crescent followed, leaving deep gashes on the road and the wall, each relatively uniform. Then, I played several videos in sequence. “Can you  see it?” I asked. </p><p>She shrunk in my lap, clearly feeling self-conscious about what she was about to say. “N-no,” she whispered. “They all look the same. Fifty-foot energy attack, with enough power to kill a normal human, but not as damaging as a bullet,” she parroted, which was more or less the common consensus.  </p><p>“Look at this, then,” I said as I opened another video and froze it in the appropriate frame. She took my words seriously as she examined the picture, trying to find exactly what I was referring to. I didn’t blame her, as I doubted that I would have noticed it if it wasn’t for my power. </p><p>“Check the blurred, dark parts,” I suggested. Even then, it took a minute for her to notice it. She gasped in shock. “O-one of the slashes is much deeper,” she said. </p><p>“Exactly, and you can see that it’s not overlap,” I said, then turned to the earlier parts of the video, and showed her exactly which attack delivered that deeper cut. “The camera is bad, but it’s still possible to see the attack is slightly thicker and brighter,” I explained. “And, look at him. He doesn’t show any kind of exhaustion after attacking with it.” </p><p>“But that means …” she gasped. </p><p>“That means he might have a stronger attack that he kept hidden to deal with stronger enemies. It might have ended up painfully if you attacked him by assuming your powers would keep you safe,” I explained, and she shivered. “Keep that a secret, and don’t engage with him unless he’s near. We can’t be sure if he has other tricks he hasn’t revealed,” I said. </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said obediently. </p><p>“Good, now. Watch the videos I arranged,” I asked her, though my smile slipped away once her attention turned. While showing her the videos, I noticed another detail. There were multiple times that he used that high-power slash, but that grainy video was the only evidence of its impact. </p><p>I suspected that someone was helping him to keep that a secret. The most likely suspect was the Syndicate, and technically, the New Giant Force wasn’t above suspicion either. </p><p>Still, ultimately, it didn’t matter. The more important thing was to discover, when the inevitable attack finally happened, who would be his support. Depending on the skill set, it could also be a very dangerous situation. </p><p>I sent a message to Emily, requesting her help. Though, I didn’t make her a direct request, but instead asked her to compile a report, giving me not just every occasion when the minor villains attacked together, but also times when their attacks happened in a certain radius and time. </p><p>It was a straightforward request, but for anyone else, it would take days to prepare. With her ability to interface with computers directly, she sent me a spreadsheet that included a report that covered the last decade, categorized based on those and many other details in less than five minutes. </p><p>‘Did you prepare that yourself or pull out of a database,’ I asked. </p><p>‘It was easy. I prepared myself. All the dates and locations were already there in the public reports. I just put them together,’ she wrote back … then attached a beautiful picture of hers, wearing pajama bottoms and nothing else. </p><p>‘Impressive,’ I wrote back, though I was more impressed with the speed she put together that report over the speed. </p><p>Her abilities meshed extremely well with mine. </p><p>As much as flirting with her was fun, I had to go through the reports. A long and possibly boring task…</p><p>But preferable to the pain of the loss. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Are you sure we should do this? It doesn’t feel honorable,” Pearyin said as she looked at me.  </p><p>“Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures,” I said, deflecting her argument. “With the city under the coup, we couldn’t afford to act like idiots.” </p><p>Not that I had any intention of following the idea of honor this new world had in the first place. </p><p>Luckily, Pearyin was a waitress just a week ago rather than a martial artist who had been indoctrinated for years, which meant she cared about my opinions more than the expectations about her new station as a high-ranking martial artist. “I understand,” she said. </p><p>“Do you remember the plan?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes. I’m going to rush at the Snow Blossom Apothecary, and threaten them to give me the manuscript while laughing like crazy. Then, I’ll take down the people that attack me without killing them, drop the smoke bomb after a minute, and escape to the temporary safe house.” </p><p>“Exactly,” I said as I looked at Pearyin, though she certainly didn’t like herself at the moment, not with the layers of makeup she had on. She looked like an old, sickly woman, with a very visible diseased left arm. </p><p>I wore a similar disguise, looking like an old, suffering man under my cloak. </p><p>I wanted them to search for a team of crazed, hopeless apothecaries after the attack. </p><p>Luckily, it was still dark, which made their job of catching anything even harder. </p><p>We were at the Snow Blossom Apothecary for two reasons. The first reason to add to the chaos. My little trick with the Tiger Fist made people tense, but I preferred them to be a little more distracted if I were to have any hope of extracting Elsana from the siege. </p><p>The second reason was simpler. I run out of herbs. Pushing Pearyin to the Peak of the Skin Refinement realm consumed my stockpile of herbs, and more importantly, the snow essence I stored in the Inventory. I needed a superior stockpile to refine more pills. </p><p>After living there for a week, I knew exactly which untouched herb storages to hit, and which gardens to harvest. Get in, collect, get out. All I needed was a minute. </p><p>Pearyin might be inexperienced, but with her Peak Skin Refinement cultivation, a minute was easy. I had already scouted the compound. With the most valuable items already removed, they left the task of guarding the place to Muscle Reinforcement experts. </p><p>Even if Skin Refinement experts reacted, I doubted they would dare to attack a desperate expert of unknown style. </p><p>“Ready?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, Master,” she said, and I moved to the other side of the compound, ready to move before she acted. I didn’t want to waste the opportunity. Whatever was about to go in the arena was my best chance to make a difference, I wanted to be ready for it. </p><p>And, even if that failed, having a variety of pills I could use wouldn’t hurt. </p><p>“Hey, old lady. Stop, you can’t walk in here,” a guard shouted. </p><p>“Give me the Snow Blossom Art, or I kill all of you, you pathetic worms!” Pearyin shouted in reply, followed by a loud thud. Like a body slamming against a wall. I could hear the nervousness in her tone, but I hoped that her sudden appearance was scary enough to distract the guards. </p><p>“She’s a Skin Refinement expert! Call reinforcements,” the guards shouted while the compound suddenly exploded in fear. Some guards moved to help, and some actually retreated to a distance. The important part, they stopped paying attention to the compound. </p><p>I infiltrated the compound and moved toward the inner garden, pulling some of the most precious plants off the ground as I moved toward the storage room, using snow essence to preserve their effect and protect myself from poisoning. </p><p>The large bag I prepared was already half-full when I arrived at the storage room I had been targeting. It was locked. </p><p>“Why not a little gift,” I said as I used a distinctive Demon Claw technique to break the lock. I had already framed Tiger Fist for taking the Volcano Hammer, which made revenge from Demon Claw a believable response. </p><p>I didn’t expect to create some kind of civil war with that trick, but there was no harm in spreading some distrust. I was sure that it could be useful sometimes. </p><p>The irony of using frathouse prank tactics during a civil war was delicious.   </p><p>As I plundered the storage room, only taking the things I needed rather than the expensive stuff, I couldn’t help but be annoyed at the fact that my Inventory only worked one way. It would have been very convenient to stuff everything inside. </p><p>Once I filled the bag, I closed the door and retreated, the whole operation not even taking thirty seconds. Hopefully, they wouldn’t even notice my burglary for a while they waited for the second attack. </p><p>Pearyin already retreated back. Meanwhile, I used my movement speed advantage to go back to the safe house to drop the large, unwieldy bag, before I went to meet with her in the agreed spot. I circled around to make sure there was no one following her before I walked to her. “Good work.” </p><p>“Thank you, Master,” she said, still breathing hard after the encounter. With the adrenaline rush she experienced, it was understandable. It was her first real fight, yet she took down existences she wasn’t even supposed to be able to look at. “What now?”  </p><p>“Now, I want you to take off your disguise, take the bag, and go back to the house while staying hidden.” </p><p>“What about you, Master?” she asked, worried. </p><p>I caressed her cheek as I chuckled. “Don’t worry about it. I have a couple of errands I need to finish, then I’ll return. Just meditate and wait for me.” </p><p>She left, but I had a different plan. Still in my disguise, I wanted to see if I could add some more chaos in the mixture, knowing that, if the worst happened, I could escape. I had some smoke bombs and fire starters that would put napalm to shame, and I was still faster than them. </p><p>I moved toward where they were gathered “Surround the area. She can’t be too far away,” someone shouted, unaware that we had long emptied that area. The disciples spread, and I moved behind them. </p><p>In the darkness, coming from the opposite direction they had been approaching, taking Muscle Refinement artists down was trivial. Just a dash and a grab, followed by a needle sinking to a critical acupuncture. </p><p>Volcano Essence was useful in forging weapons, its scorching heat destroying the impurities in the metal. It was even more useful destroying acupuncture points and meridians, ruining their cultivation permanently before I left them down, to be discovered by their allies. </p><p>I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of guilt as I did that. It ruined their life, but it was still easier than killing. They might not consider it a mercy, but that was not my problem. </p><p>I had taken down eight Muscle Reinforcement martial artists in less than a minute, five city guards, and three from Tiger Fist. I had the opportunity to take down a few Demon Claw Disciples as well, but I deliberately avoided them. </p><p>After all, I wanted some inconvenient questions to be asked. </p><p>“Gather together. Someone’s attacking us,” one of the Skin Refinement artists shouted — the loudness of his shout enough to reveal his cultivation — and the disciples started to gather toward them. Of course, he just thought his disciples to be unconscious, and not their cultivation ruined. </p><p>That was a surprise for the future. </p><p>I moved to his location faster than his allies. I was glad to see that he was an instructor of the Tiger Fist, which meant my little ploy wouldn’t be ruined.  </p><p>I deliberately kept my face revealed, which was covered in scars and boils. “Tell your superiors to give me the Snow Blossom manuscript, or you won’t be the only one,” I said. </p><p>“What are you talking about, you man. How dare you fight against us —” he started, but switched to a devastating attack when I continued to rush forward. “Tiger’s Revenge!” he shouted even as he used a Skin Refinement realm attack.</p><p>Too bad for him that, I knew that attack better than him. Rather than pulling back like he expected, I rushed forward, dodging it easily, and stabbed his arm with a needle, which, not only delivered a poison, but also a blast of Volcano Essence. </p><p>It wasn’t enough to disable him completely, but it was still enough to take away the use of his arm for a moment. “What did you do —” he started as he found his arm not working. The only reason I was able to stab through the defenses of a Skin Refinement martial artist was the quality of the needles that I received from the System. </p><p>Profound Peak-Grade was truly magnificent. </p><p>“Just something to make sure my lesson stuck,” I said as I stuck close. He tried to defend against me, but his attacks were easy to predict, and even easier to counter. My knowledge of Tiger Fist, combined with my martial talent, made the achievement trivial. </p><p>Ten seconds was all I needed to destroy his cultivation completely. “Remember. I want the Snow Blossom manuscript at the city gate tomorrow morning, or I get serious.” </p><p>With that, I threw a smoke bomb on the ground and moved away while they were coughing madly. </p><p>It was a fascinating achievement. Unfortunately, I still remembered that random true cultivator that I came across when I arrived in this world, and the shimmering barrier that kept the manor safe from an army was another reminder. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I wasn’t able to get a long glimpse of Marana as they kept the door open only enough for a servant to bring some food to their prisoner, but the glimpse I caught was enough to show that the situation was even more complicated. </p><p>She looked in good condition, which was better than the alternative. More interestingly, I noticed she had been wearing a very distinct blue outfit, of the same style as the Crane Kick school. I didn’t recognize the exact rank, but it was clearly not a disciple.</p><p>She was probably an instructor. Based on the System returns when she was helping me, her cultivation was somewhere between Intermediate and Advanced Skin Refinement. Though, that left the question, of why the hell she was defended so tightly. </p><p>It was clear that she would fight during tomorrow’s show. Why, I had no idea, but that was a question for the future. For now, she was safely locked in a cell, and kept comfortable. Probably because she played an important role in tomorrow’s show, but it meant there was nothing I needed to do urgently. </p><p>I continued to sweep the floor for ten more minutes before slowly slinking away. As I left the Arena behind, I couldn’t help but curse at the coincidences I had been facing … and wondering if they were actually coincidences. </p><p>I hadn’t been someone to believe fate. Even when a freak injury derailed my life, I treated it as a mere coincidence more than anything.  </p><p>But a change in perspective was not exactly an absurd stance. Not after I was thrown into a new world through a lightning bolt due to an irate divine being. </p><p>Ultimately, I shrugged. Whether it was coincidence, or it was something that was somehow the fault of the angry goddess — or whatever she was — that sent me here didn’t matter that much, certainly not immediately. I needed to decide what to do with Marana first. </p><p>To be fair, while I owed Marana, I certainly didn’t owe her enough to risk my life for her. If it was her alone, I would have just left some pills to Crane Kick School to pay her back indirectly and move away. But Elsana’s presence complicated matters.</p><p>And, since they were putting some weight on tomorrow’s show, I decided to play along a bit. </p><p>First, I returned to my home. Pearyin was already up, and practicing her new moves. I watched her as she moved through the Muscle Reinforcement forms of the Forest Dance technique, her takedown moves incredibly smooth, like she had been practicing for months. </p><p>The improvement granted by her breakthrough was incredible. </p><p>It was not as incredible as how good she looked. She moved between moves, looking as graceful as a ballet dancer. I had already practiced the moves, and knew just how smoothly they connected, elevating it into something more than a random pick of several moves.  </p><p>It looked fascinating when practiced by a beautiful woman, making it unfortunate that we lacked the time to celebrate. </p><p>Lost in her my, she didn’t notice my presence until I spoke. “You’re extending your center of weight too much,” I spoke. Rather than turning toward me, ready to engage, she jumped in fear. </p><p>“M-master,” she said as I waved at her, self-conscious about her reaction. I didn’t blame her for it. She might have had a martial arts cultivation that was strong enough to put her into the upper echelons of the city, but that didn’t make her a competent fighter. </p><p>Luckily, I didn’t need her to fight. </p><p>“Don’t feel bad, you were focused on your training. How does your new realm feel.” </p><p>“I-incredible,” she stammered as she dragged her hand over the wall, which, despite applying no pressure, left a deep line, like she used a chisel. </p><p>Skin Refinement was an interesting realm. Muscle Reinforcement uses essence as some kind of super blood to power muscles above and beyond their usual limits. Meanwhile, Skin Refinement allowed the essence to imbue the surface of the body directly, increasing the defenses and delivering harder hits at the same time. </p><p>When a Skin Refinement martial artist was talking about their body being a weapon, they weren’t using metaphors. </p><p>Of course, in addition to that ability, there were passive improvements as well. Even without using any essence actively, they were still faster, stronger, and overall more perceptive. Altogether, a Skin Refinement realm artist could easily take down a dozen Peak Muscle Reinforcement artists at the same time. </p><p>The jump between tiers was no joke. </p><p>“Come at me,” I said, making a gesture at her. For the first time since I arrived, I had the chance to spar. With everything going on, some practical experience would help despite my talent.</p><p>“A-are you sure, Master. I … I thought you were at Muscle Reinforcement realm,” she said. </p><p>I might have reacted to her words more negatively if she sounded smug just because she was in a higher realm, but she was just concerned. “I am, but don’t worry about it,” I said. “Just come at me with your full power,” I said.  </p><p>Pearyin attacked. Her inexperience was obvious as she rushed. Moreover, she clearly ignored my order to come at me with full strength, and instead used a simple Initiate stage move, thinking that the difference in strength and reaction speed would be enough to make a difference. </p><p>Admittedly, it might have made a difference … if I wasn’t the one who designed those moves in the first place, and knew how to counter them easily. When she reached to grab my wrist, which would inevitably be followed by the most painless takedown I had taught her, I adjusted my arm slightly, took half a step forward, and used a throwing move. </p><p>I could have used the attack to slam her into the ground. No matter how fast and strong she was, there was very little she could do to change her trajectory while she didn’t hold anything. Martial arts were amazing, but not to the point of flying unaided. </p><p>Instead, I threw her straight, which gave her plenty of time to recover so that rather than hitting the wall, she stepped gently against it. But, as she got her proper footing, she looked surprised at how it ended. “Come again. Limit yourself to Initiate moves, but use your full speed,” I ordered, and she attacked again. </p><p>Her every attempt ended up in failure, but that only made her more enthusiastic. For some reason, seeing that her abilities were inferior helped her excitement rather than blunting her enthusiasm. My enhanced martial abilities proved useful once more, allowing me to catch every single mistake she made and give me exactly how to fix it. </p><p>We continued to spar. </p><p>I limited myself to Forest Dance. I trusted her, but only up to a point. For example, I had no idea what she would do if she was ordered by the city lord. If it came to there, there was no harm in revealing that I was some kind of genius traveling for experience rather than a waste, and had some kind of technique to keep my real cultivation suppressed. </p><p>Not only it was less threatening than a man who could invent a brand new martial technique school in a week, but also it implied that the support behind me was much bigger.</p><p>Naturally, that was the last choice, as once people believed that it was my real background, I would become a much bigger target. Even with my abilities, I didn’t fancy trying to fight against an army. </p><p>And, if that story spread, there would be no System Rewards to make my life easier. </p><p>We practiced together until midnight, which helped Pearyin to get much better control of her abilities. Only when she started to use the Skin Refinement Realm moves, I was forced to defend aggressively. </p><p>It was a good exercise, which also taught me something important. Fighting across realms was even more difficult than I had first realized, which made me reconsider my decision not to break through, which would limit my benefits significantly. </p><p>Still, I persevered. I was still far faster than her, meaning I should be able to escape from anyone. And, as for fighting against the army directly, it was out of the question. Technically, I could do it if I pushed myself to reach the Connate Realm. </p><p>But the sudden appearance of an unknown Connate Realm martial artist would be a dangerous situation. It was like using an unidentified jet fighter flying above the city. It wouldn’t matter if it killed gang members. It would still trigger a national emergency. </p><p>Something that needed to be avoided except as a last resort. </p><p>“It’s time for more breakthroughs,” I finally said. </p><p>“A-another breakthrough,” she stammered in shock. “B-but, I’m already at the Skin Refinement realm.” </p><p>“It’s just Beginner Skin Refinement,” I said. “Not to mention, with your lack of experience, I doubt you can win against another, so we’re going to cheat,” I said. </p><p>“I … I don’t know what to say, Master,” she said, looking shocked like I had just informed her that she had won the lottery. Though, in a way, she did. </p><p>“Say nothing, then,” I said, deliberately dismissive, hoping to reduce her enthusiasm somewhat. It didn’t work. “You know the drill, lay on your back, and be ready for my help,” I said.  </p><p>Though, even as I walked away, I couldn’t help but feel annoyed. Pearyin was even more beautiful after her multiple breakthroughs, and she was eager to thank me for everything she had received from me. </p><p>Unfortunately, with everything going on, a celebration was out of the question. Instead, I planned to spend the next hour sticking needles and feeding pills, rather than the fun alternatives. </p><p>We still had a lot of work to do. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Despite the curfew, scouting the city had been surprisingly easy. I expected the streets to be filled with patrol squads, but it was surprisingly empty. A few patrols here and there, but avoiding them had been easy. </p><p>The reason, as it turned out to be, twofold. The first part was the city gates, manned by far more soldiers than I had seen before, in full alert, making any attempt to escape troubling at best, maybe even impossible. </p><p>The second reason was the larger army surrounding the manor of the city lord. Several rows of soldiers, all ready to act, while the walls of the city lord’s manor were equally crowded. Whatever triggered this mess, I had no idea, but the current situation was easier to understand. </p><p>Lord Eirto was currently in the process of a military takeover, and he had already taken control of the whole city, the manor being the only exception. The only thing that prevented him from succeeding was some kind of shimmering barrier that surrounded the place. </p><p>At this point,  I lived in this new world to know that it was an artifact of true cultivation that was responsible for it, its limits unknown. </p><p>Worse, at a distance, I could see two familiar figures at the walls of the manor along with the rest. Lannayin and Elsana. Or at least, that was who I assumed to be the great distance, but how many blonde ladies with pure white robes that accompanied by a black haired woman that carried a huge hammer. </p><p>“Damn it,” I growled as I pulled back into the shadows. I couldn’t help but curse my luck repeatedly as I faced an unexpected calamity. I had already planned to abandon Elsana … but I wasn’t planning to abandon her in the middle of a coup. </p><p>I was a selfish asshole … but even I had my limits. And, abandoning the woman that I had been making love to almost without a stop for the last week to death was not one of them. </p><p>Worse, I couldn’t just lie to myself and say that there was nothing I could do, not when that was an obvious lie. My enhanced martial talent alone gave me several options, not to mention the seemingly unlimited benefits granted by the System. </p><p>I was far from helpless. At worst, I could train rapidly to Bone Forging Realm, which, combined with my knowledge of many different martial arts, should be enough to resolve the situation. However, it was the last choice, as it would ruin the extra return I had been enjoying. </p><p>Luckily, with the barrier around the manor, the situation was currently locked in a status quo, freeing me from the obligation of acting immediately. I moved along the dark alleys, even using the opportunity to add a few parkour moves to my sprinting-based movement technique. It helped me to move even faster in the city. .</p><p>My increased martial cultivation at the Peak of the Muscle Reinforcement Stage helped quite a bit as well. </p><p>With the coup forces controlling the critical points, I was relatively free to explore the inner city and take account of the current distribution. </p><p>The barracks were already under Lord Eirto’s control, city guards mixing with Dragon Saber martial artists. However, there were several bloody spots around the place, showing that it didn’t happen without blood. </p><p>The arena was under their control as well. Interestingly, the arena was still operational, with fires burning. It wasn’t open to civilians. Only people who were wearing the uniforms of the city guards, or the three allied Martial Schools — Tiger Fist, Demon Claw, and Dragon Saber — were going in and out. </p><p>I visited several other locations of interest. Snow Blossom Apothecary was filled with city guards who were currently going through room after room, cataloging and carrying away everything, be it pills, money, or books. </p><p>The only thing they didn’t touch was the herbs, both in the garden, and Elsana’s private stores. Most plants there were too fragile to be handled by anyone but an expert. </p><p>The guards of the place were helping the soldiers happily, which was rather surprising. </p><p>The compounds of Wolf Fang and Crane Kick schools were similarly surrounded, though this time, it was a mixture of Tiger Fist and Demon Claw disciples rather than city guards. Also, there were no true cultivation barriers protecting the place, which made their continued existence interesting. The Wolf Fang and Crane Kick disciples sported many wounds, and their numbers were even lower than I expected. </p><p>They clearly suffered many casualties. </p><p>Curious, I decided to visit Lannayin’s forge, only to find it not only already robbed, but also demolished. At first, I assumed it was an act of wanton destruction, but then, I realized that I group of workers was carefully breaking everything, including walls and floor, while a bunch of guards carefully watched. </p><p>Searching for something. </p><p>“What an interesting opportunity,” I thought. Listening to them for less than a minute, it became clear that they were looking for the manuscript of the Volcano Hammer Art. I sincerely doubted that it was there — I doubted Elsana would allow that despite knowing the incoming crisis — but that didn’t mean I couldn’t throw a little chaos in the midst. </p><p>“I just need to treat this as a frat hazing,” I said, remembering the time we disguised ourselves as another frat while stealing the flag of our rivals, triggering a prank battle between them that lasted a year before they realized what was going on, each ready to believe the worst about the other group. </p><p>And, as someone who could use all five martial arts, I was in a unique position to do so. I sneaked forward, waiting for an opportunity. </p><p>It came when one of the workers came across a particularly strong stone. “I found something,” he shouted. I was sure that it was a dud, but I still rushed forward. </p><p>The sudden appearance of a cloaked figure was enough to alarm the guards, but they were not prepared to be attacked. I kicked the nearest guard away easily before I continued moving forward. At my full speed, I could have ditched them easily. </p><p>Instead, once I grabbed the rock, I slowed down enough for the guards to catch up. As I watched them, it became clear that none of them were stronger than Intermediate Muscle Reinforcement, so letting them surround me was less risky than it sounded. </p><p>I tried to punch a path to myself, deliberately not using anything but ordinary kicks and punches like a brawler. Then, just when they surrounded me successfully, I growled in anger, and delivered three Tiger Ascend punches in a row. </p><p>Pushing the purest essence I could push. Then, just as the city guards processed the shock that they were robbed by one of their allies, I started running toward the Tiger Fist compound. “Catch the thief,” shouted the guards, some even shot some kind of fireworks, probably functioning as a signal. </p><p>That was why, the moment I was sure that I ditched them, I changed my direction and ran at full speed. </p><p>I had planted a seed, which was enough for the moment. I slowed down once I was safely away from the inner city, and discarded the rock  — which turned out to be an ordinary piece of rubble like I suspected — before changing my clothes and returning to the arena. </p><p>I was curious about why they prioritized the place. Sneaking into the arena was easier than I expected. After my little trick at the forge, a significant portion of the city guards moved there to cut the path of the mysterious thief, mistakenly under the impression that they managed to surround me successfully. </p><p>With the number of guards lowered even further, sneaking in had been easy. “Work harder, you bastards!” I heard someone shout even before I entered. “Everything has to be perfect for tomorrow’s show.” </p><p>I didn’t appear immediately. Instead, I used one of the corridors that led to the cheapest seats at the top, with poorer visibility, which was the place with the lowest worker density. </p><p>Still, I was surprised to see more than a thousand workers carefully cleaning the VIP section, covering it with silk drapes, flags, and some expensive-looking decorative items. An interesting focus considering they were in the middle of the coup. </p><p>My guess, is it had something to do with why Lord Eirto suddenly felt confident enough to deliver a coup. </p><p>Then, a particular section grabbed my attention. Twelve guards were standing in front of the tunnel that led into the arena. Every single one of them belonged to one of the martial schools. More interestingly, two of them were familiar. </p><p>Two Tiger Fist disciples, the ones that gave me the gold coin back at Dumassa. Not exactly someone I expected to meet. Even more interestingly, they were the guards with the lowest ranking. There were nine disciples from the three schools, but they were not equally distributed. Four disciples from Tiger Fist and Demon Claw, and one from Dragon Saber. </p><p>Though, from their attitude toward that sole Dragon Saber disciple, I doubted the disparity was a slight against the Dragon Saber school. Yet, I didn’t pay much attention to the young ones, not when there were three older men who stood behind them, each dressed in the unique pattern of their school to mark them as instructors. </p><p>Which meant, at a minimum, in the Beginner Skin Refinement realm, marking them as experts. </p><p>Their presence discouraged me from approaching further. Instead, I stayed in my place, using a stolen broom to act like a servant while I observed the tunnel. “Curiosity kills the cat,” I murmured as moved slightly closer when they opened the door, trying to catch a glimpse of exactly who required such a significant number of guards. </p><p>Though, with my luck, I should have been able to guess it in the first place. </p><p>Marana, the softhearted cook.  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I didn’t immediately stop to think. Instead, I pulled a set of clothes from my Inventory and changed my looks — making some temporary hair dye was even easier with my new looks. </p><p>Once I avoided the kidnappers, I wanted to go back to the house I rented. I walked at a leisurely pace, even stopping by a few stalls to purchase some knick-knacks. I didn’t need anything, but a desperately running man was far more memorable than a lazy shopper. </p><p>I was glad for it, as a mere five minutes after I got away from the carriage, a bell suddenly started to ring, and armored city guards appeared on the streets. “Everyone, go back to your houses and wait for inspection. From this moment, the city is under martial law!” the guards shouted, declaring a sudden change. </p><p>Not for a moment, I thought that it was actually about me. I wasn’t important enough. It was much easier to believe I was a target of opportunity; which unfortunately created other unfortunate questions, like how Lord Eirto knew that there would be a declaration of curfew.  </p><p>Regardless of the political machinations, I was glad that I didn’t try to escape the city immediately. A man without a valid identity, trying to leave the city in a hurry just as the city gates were about to close … yeah, that was not the mess I needed. </p><p>I would return to the house I rented, which was my best hope to stay under the radar. But, before, I stepped by several stores, purchasing as many herbs as I could, even though I had to pay quite a premium. Luckily, with everyone in a hurry to follow the emergency orders, I wasn’t the only one who was frantically making some purchases, so it didn’t look suspicious. </p><p>Twenty minutes later, I was at my house. I went to the door, knocking it in the agreed pattern. The door opened, revealing Pearyin, who wore both a cloak and a veil. “Young master?” she asked, unable to recognize me in my disguise. </p><p>“Yes, sweetie. It’s me,” I said as I stepped in and closed the door behind me. </p><p>“What’s going on?” she asked, looking out in worry. </p><p>“I have no idea, but nothing good. Follow me,” I said. She followed obediently. “Give me your hand,” I said, and when she did so, I put my hand on her pulse, assessing the situation of her body. “You’re already a Peak Initiate, very good,” I said. </p><p>“It’s only thanks to the essence pills you have left me with, young master,” she said demurely, my touch enough to make her blush. </p><p>It was not entirely true. Even with the pills, reaching the Peak Initiate stage in a week was still a decent achievement, showing that her martial aptitude was not poor. Nowhere near to being called amazing, but still decent enough to be rapidly improved if I piled her with pills. </p><p>“Sit down,” I said seriously, and she followed. “We’re in trouble, and there’s some high-ranking people gunning for me. I’m going to give you a chance. You can hide in the house until the curfew is lifted, and then leave. You’re already a Peak Initiate, and it should be enough for you to find a decent job anywhere you want.” </p><p>Her help would be useful, but I didn’t want to force her to do it. It was a dangerous situation. To be honest, I would have acted far more manipulative if it was a life-or-death situation, but I was confident to stay concealed even without her help. </p><p>At worst, I would just use the essence pills I had in my Inventory and push for the Skin Refinement realm and try to escape. Return multipliers were nice, but being alive was better. </p><p>“A-are you chasing me away, Master?” she asked, which answered my question. </p><p>“No, I’m not chasing you away. I’m just giving you a choice—” I started, ready to explain the other option. </p><p>“I chose to stay,” she said, her gaze determined. “You gave me everything. I’m ready to die for you,” she started. </p><p>“No dying,” I said, but didn’t bother to explain. “But, it’ll probably hurt a bit, and there’s a chance it’ll ruin your future as a martial artist,” I said. </p><p>“Whatever you need,” she said, her beautiful face far more determined than I expected, showing that, even now, I was underestimating the importance of martial arts. Just because I had taught her, she was ready to die to for me. </p><p>“If that’s what you wish,” I said and displayed her the full set of Muscle Refinement moves, along with their mantras. “Go to the training room, and start practicing them. I’ll be there in a couple of hours.”</p><p>“I won’t disappoint you, Master,” she said decisively and walked away. </p><p> I went to the medicine lab I had set up. “Let’s put what I learned to practice,” I said as I pulled several things from my inventory. A new cauldron of higher quality, a set of needles, and a beautiful knife, were all improved versions of Elsana’s gifts when I asked her to teach me how to refine medicine. </p><p>Unfortunately, she only intended to teach ordinary medicine, which meant I only had a few herbs in my inventory. </p><p>Still, the white and glistening cauldron was not only beautiful, but also very high quality. The quality of the equipment was important. I was skilled enough to work with subpar equipment and still got amazing results when refining Muscle Reinforcement pills, but trying to refine Skin Refinement Grade pills was a different challenge. </p><p>Even with all my acquired skills, I needed the assistance of the equipment … and the Snow Essence I had in my inventory. Every time I shared Elsana’s bed, some of her Snow Essence invaded my body, which the System treated as a reward rather than an unwelcome side effect, and multiplied the effect. </p><p>And, now, I used more than half of that stored essence to forge the pills, the sudden burst of power proving useful. The higher the rank of the pill, the more energy it required. The stored essence allowed me to skip the step of eating and absorbing the energy, which was a significant benefit. </p><p>Two hours later, I was looking for a number of Muscle Reinforcement and Skin Refinement pills that could be auctioned for hundreds of thousands of gold easily, but I ignored that value as I first went to the bathroom, prepared a bath, and threw some of the pills I had prepared.</p><p>It will be required soon.  </p><p>Pearyin was in the middle of the room, carefully trying to practice the Muscle Refinement moves, but failed to pull them. “Get rid of your dress and lay down,” I ordered. She blushed as she pulled her dress down. “Keep the underwear,” I said when I noticed she was ready to get rid of them as well. </p><p>No need to invite any temptation to what would be a very complicated process. </p><p>“Now, eat the first pill,” I said even as I pulled several acupuncture needles from the case. The moment she consumed the pill, I started blocking several of her acupuncture points and gates, making sure the essence would gather only in certain parts of her body. </p><p>“Tell me if the pain gets unbearable, and we’ll stop,” I said as she groaned. Unfortunately, there was no avoiding the hurt during the process, but considering it took less than a minute for her to step into the Muscle Reinforcement realm, it was hard to argue that it was a bad deal. </p><p>She managed not to shout, which was impressive. Forceful breakthroughs were hardly the smoothest experience. </p><p>“Now, the second pill,” I said, as I fed her another pill, my hands still on her back as I channeled her essence based as required by the Forest Dance. Five minutes, and she reached the Intermediate Stage, fifteen minutes, she was at the Advanced Stage, and an hour later, she reached the Peak Muscle Reinforcement stage. </p><p>Bringing her to the same level with the most valuable disciples of the martial arts schools. Naturally, she couldn’t actually win anything close to a fair fight, as she lacked the experience, but it didn’t make the achievement any less impressive. </p><p>Yet, I wanted to push more. </p><p>I doubted anyone else could replicate what I was doing. Helping someone break through a minor stage was difficult enough, but two major stages … it was nothing less than a miracle, possible only because of my unique combination of skills, channeled by my enhanced martial aptitude. Not to mention, it was supposed to exhaust my Essence completely, but that was resolved by the Snow Essence in my inventory. </p><p>“We can stop if you can’t handle it, but it’ll be better if we continue,” I said. </p><p>“I can handle it,” she said, pushing through the pain, impressing me with her resilience. </p><p>“Very good,” I said I fed her first of the Skin Refinement pills, allowing her to break through once more. It was already evening when we stopped, and I was feeling utterly exhausted. Worse, I failed to control my own essence fully, and had two breakthroughs, bringing me to the Peak Muscle Reinforcement realm. </p><p>Admittedly, it wasn’t too bad. It represented a further drop in the potential returns, but with the city under martial law, a little extra power wouldn’t be amiss. </p><p>Even better, I got a maid at the Peak of Skin Refinement Realm, so that effort was certainly worth it.</p><p> She fell unconscious after her breakthrough, so I carried her to the bath, positioning so that she wouldn’t accidentally drown while the medicinal bath I prepared earlier soothed her body and dealt with some of the worst side effects of her forced breakthrough. </p><p>I wanted to sleep, but with the number of soldiers moving around, I didn’t have the luxury. So, I popped an essence pill to renew my energy, changed my clothes, and prepared for a scouting mission. </p>",

    "content": "<p>A week. </p><p>It had been a week since Elsana and Lannayin had their fight about the issue. Lannayin didn’t visit the place again, but Elsana’s annoyed murmuring whenever she returned from a meeting from the City Lord’s manor showed that they were still at odds. Elsana wanted to leave the city, and Lannayin wanted to stay and fight. </p><p>The frequency of the meetings and the intensity of their arguments suggested that the situation in the city was getting even worse. Leaving the city was the smart choice. </p><p>Yet, I stayed. Elsana loved the unique brand of stress management I had introduced a lot. Whenever she returned from a meeting, she dragged me to the bedroom, where we had one of our night-long sessions where I kept her relaxed, and she talked about her cultivation troubles. </p><p>I had to admit, the risk was worth it. With the System constantly multiplying the results, I had excellent gains. First of all, my Apothecary abilities had reached an absurd level. According to the System Returns, I was already at Perfection for ordinary medicines, and reached Major Accomplishment for the essence medicine refinement. </p><p>Something that was supposed to take years of dedicated training. </p><p>At the same time, I managed to swindle a shocking number of recipes and other books, which were all multiplied by the System. I even managed to get better versions of the five martial arts, the quality of the books reaching the Profound Low-Grade. </p><p>That way, whenever Elsana was away, I practiced the five arts. It increased my combat ability significantly. Yet, since I avoided making a breakthrough, I still managed to maintain the high multiplier. </p><p>Another weirdness of the System. The more I used it, the more I started to realize that the mysterious Divine being didn’t put much thought into my punishment. </p><p>I wasn’t complaining. </p><p>In addition to working on the five arts, I did my best to work on the martial arts I had called Forest Dance. Since the people of this world treated martial arts schools more seriously than nationality, using others publicly was not exactly a smart idea. Though, that wasn’t the only reason I had worked hard on it while staying locked in my room. </p><p>All five arts were focused extremely on striking first and striking hard. Not a bad strategy considering Muscle Reinforcement allowed people to hit hard enough to kill others in one hit, but without a matching defensive capability. Since only rare few people were able to reach Skin Refinement and improve their defensive arts, the popularity of the strike-fist arts was inevitable. </p><p>However, my situation was a bit different. I had both the Essence Massage technique, and the matching apothecary abilities. I didn’t need to punch someone’s heart out. A jolt of Essence to the right Acupuncture point would be enough to temporarily disable someone. </p><p>Or, permanently destroy their martial cultivation if they angered me. For something that essentially granted superpowers to people, Martial Cultivation was surprisingly fragile. </p><p>I wanted to develop that ability, because I still didn’t know how I felt about killing, despite how commonplace it was in this new world. Even imagining was squeamish. I rather destroy their cultivation and leave them alive unless I had no other choice. </p><p>Though, I doubted that they would actually treat it as mercy. Everything I had seen until now showed that they would prefer to be killed … but it wasn’t my problem. Ultimately, I didn’t want to kill people for my own mental comfort. </p><p>What a weird new world in that not being a serial killer or ruthless conqueror was treated as a character flaw. A significant one…</p><p>“… your soup tea is getting cold, young master,” the servant reminded me from his position, pulling me from my thoughts. </p><p>“Sorry, I was just inspired to write another poem,” I said, ignoring the sneer that he thought that he kept hidden while I took the teacup … the reason I was suddenly lost in my thoughts about an accounting of the last week. </p><p>The tea was drugged. </p><p>I still drank the tea. I wasn’t afraid of the drug in the slightest. It was just an ordinary sleeping drug that would put me unconscious, but it would only work on an Initiate. With their essence active, Muscle Reinforcement martial artists could disable it relatively easily … and with the apothecary knowledge that I collected, I had about a dozen methods to disable it. </p><p>Unfortunately, the problem wasn’t the drug, but the fact that one of the servants actually dared to indirectly attack me. Not for a moment, I thought Elsana approved it. Not only she didn’t need to use such tactics to take me down with our closeness, but she would treat a simple drug like this as an insult. </p><p>She was very stringent when it came to the quality of the products she used. The drug they used with the tea was not only low quality, but also it wasn’t even refined using the Snow Blossom method — which I was able to identify easily thanks to my greatly improved Apothecary abilities. </p><p>It was an outside attack. </p><p>The servant didn’t even bother hiding his elation as I finished the tea. “S-something is wrong,” I murmured less than a minute later, and collapsed down. </p><p>I wanted to see exactly what he wanted to do. </p><p>“It’s done,” he called, and four guards entered the room, each wearing the unique armor of the Snow Blossom Apothecary, but two of them, I never saw before. </p><p>“Very good, our lord will reward you nicely,” one of the unknown faces said, while the other grabbed and lifted me easily. I let that happen, using the contact to measure his cultivation. </p><p>Peak Muscle Reinforcement stage. </p><p>It surprised me. Foreign support part was inevitable, as no servant would dare to attack a guest without someone someone high ranking arranging for it. Yet, when he drugged me, I assumed it was one of the jealous apprentices — as there were several that watched me jealously while I ‘attended’ their precious Master — behind it. </p><p>Sending two Peak Muscle Reinforcement martial artists was a different matter. Significantly so. Naturally, Lord Eirto was the biggest suspect, but not the only one. The city politics was complicated enough that maybe it was someone else who had the idea of blackmailing Elsana by kidnapping her lover. </p><p>I didn’t care much about who was the responsible party as much as the next steps I should take. I could shout and alert the guards to the situation. My kidnappers were strong, but not strong enough to deal with all the guards. </p><p>The compound had more than a dozen Muscle Reinforcement experts that guarded the compound, and they should have been able to defeat the two even without my help. But, the presence of the two guards changed the equation. </p><p>I had no idea how many of them were actually aware of what was going on, or would actually fight against two experts to save me. With my reputation as a coward who lived off a woman, I was hardly a beloved figure. </p><p>More importantly, there was another issue. Why now? What gave them the courage to kidnap someone from Elsana’s house despite the great disrespect it implied. </p><p>Maybe it was time for me to leave, at least temporarily. Kidnapping gave me an excuse to disappear for a moment. </p><p>In the end, I continued to fake unconsciousness while my kidnappers used a servant entrance to bring me away … which confirmed that I did the right thing by not shouting. In the middle of the day, this entrance should have been very busy. Instead, it was empty, showing that the number of collaborators was significant. </p><p>They put me in a carriage. One of the kidnappers took the driver’s seat, while the other stayed with me. I was planning to wait until we were out of the city. After all, wilderness was the best place to deal with a victim. At least, I expected them to bring me to the slums. </p><p>But to my surprise, our destination was the exact opposite, right in the middle of the city. Not good. I needed to act. I wasn’t afraid of dealing with the kidnapper in the privacy of the closed carriage, especially when his guard was down. </p><p>I wanted to learn who ordered it first. It would change the way I dealt with them. “W-what’s going on…” I muttered as I opened my eyes, looking dazed. </p><p>“You angered someone you shouldn’t anger, little boy,” said the kidnapper gleefully, which was good enough as confirmation. </p><p>“W-who?” I asked, slurring badly while wanting to make sure. He just smirked and didn’t answer. “Don’t tell me that pathetic bastard lord of yours,” I added. </p><p>“How dare you insult Lord Eirto, you pathetic waste,” he growled in anger, not only confirming the identity of my kidnapper, but also putting himself in a very dangerous position. He grabbed my throat, but I grabbed the back of his neck, my grip ineffectual enough for him to ignore. </p><p>Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said for the small burst of essence that I pushed out of my finger, destroying one of his most critical acupuncture points. It was a delicate operation, which required me to hold my finger on there for five seconds. </p><p>Which, in combat terms, was an eternity, but he was too busy strangling me happily to even register the risk until he felt his power disappear. “Good night,” I said, and he collapsed. </p><p>I stayed in the cart for ten more seconds, utterly destroying his cultivation while I pulled one of the curtains slightly to wait for an opportunity to sneak out. </p><p>I didn’t want to deal with the driver, which was out in the open. Instead, I waited until we were in an alley before I opened the door slightly and dashed into the alley. </p><p>I was prepared for a mad chase which might have forced me to escape. Luckily, the other kidnapper was too confident in their success to watch the carriage carefully, and I easily disappeared into the alley. </p><p>Now, I needed to decide what to do next. </p>",

    "content": "<p>“Jason,” she gasped in arousal as I took a step forward, enjoying the sight of her sexy body from an excellent angle. </p><p>“Yes, Emily,” I said, deliberately using her name. Somehow, it made the moment even sexier. It risked breaking the spell, but when I raised the phone once more and looked at her from the screen, her passion returned with a significant increase. “You have your toy. Why don’t you start playing with it?” </p><p>“Excellent idea,” she said, even when I took a step forward and positioned myself in a way to cut her escape route. Her earlier reticence gone, she grabbed my shaft with the same hand she had been masturbating, her fingers still wet. </p><p>Her fingers danced while I took several photos, but not before turning on the volume to the maximum, the artificial shutter sound echoing in the silence of the room. Anyone else, the idea that they were being recorded while giving a naked — well, technically half naked, but with the way she sat, it didn’t matter — handjob would have scared them. </p><p>It made her even more excited. </p><p>“Come on, Emily. I’m sure a sexy model like you could put that to use much more effectively.” </p><p>“What a demanding photographer,” she said. I didn’t respond, as it wouldn’t be fair, since she followed that by leaning forward and capturing my girth with her beautiful lips. For all her displays, the way she moved was hesitant, showing her lack of experience with the real thing. </p><p>I said nothing, but I made sure to wear a satisfied smile. Enthusiasm could always overcome a lack of experience, and she was certainly not lacking in that aspect. Soon, she got more familiar with my presence, taking it deeper and deeper, and every second of it had been immortalized forever. </p><p>“How about we try something different,” I suggested a minute after we started. </p><p>“Like what,” she said. </p><p>“I have a feeling that your pretty breasts would look amazing wrapped around my cock,” I said, deliberately abandoning the earlier ambiguity for crassness. We had already played enough. </p><p>“What an excellent idea,” she said as she rose to her knees. Her tits wrapped warmly around my presence, and she started moving up and down, maddeningly slow. I would have assumed it was her inexperience, but the maddening grin she wore showed that it was deliberate. </p><p>Naughty. Too bad I knew exactly how to counter it. I kept taking photos, but I raised my foot against her skirt, gently raising it until my foot was against her pussy, with the fabric of her skirt as a layer. “Ohh,” she gasped.</p><p>“Is something wrong?” I asked with exaggerated concern, wearing a matching smirk. </p><p>“N-nothing,” she said, quick to recognize the challenge and accept it readily. </p><p>She chose … poorly. </p><p>My foot started to move to her exact pace, but I had the added benefit of my power, allowing me to cheat on the exact pressure I applied. Her breath sped up instantly while her eyes widened, the pleasure hitting her hard. </p><p>She picked up speed. I matched it. She smiled victoriously for a second, thinking that her climax was not too far away, but soon, that was replaced by a shocked expression. Despite the speed, she stayed at the edge. </p><p>Naughty. </p><p>“I … I see,” she whispered, then leaned forward to capture the head of my shaft, her tits still wrapped around the base as she moved back and forth desperately, trying to push me to climax to earn hers. </p><p>It was tempting to teach her the risks of assuming such a thing, but she had helped too much to turn the night into a lesson. </p><p>We had enough time in the future. </p><p>Instead, I focused on capturing the amazing view as she finally achieved her target, which ended up with her face painted beautifully. I crouched down, and slipped my fingers inside her wetness. She said nothing, just moaned furiously as I pumped her. </p><p>And climaxed. </p><p>I made sure to take a lot of photos of that memorable event as I took a step back. Then, I sat next to her. “Now, do you want to check these amazing photos?” </p><p>She looked at me absentmindedly, like she was trying to understand why I wasn’t continuing with our fun. That confusion disappeared when I pulled her on my lap, and opened the gallery. “This is a personal favorite of mine,” I said as I opened one of the earlier photos.  </p><p>“May I grab a wet wipe,” she asked. </p><p>“No.  You look very photogenic like this,” I replied as I moved to the latest photos, showing one I took from close, her face covered with my seed. “Don’t you agree?” </p><p>“I … I agree,” she said, shivering. A moan followed as I slipped a hand under her skirt until life returned to my shaft. </p><p>Under the circumstances, it didn’t take long. Barely half a minute later, I pulled my hand out. “Do you mind holding the phone for a moment,” I said. She did, and I grabbed her legs, lifting her for a moment…</p><p>Only to lower right onto my hard shaft. The moan she let out as I pressed against her entrance was beautiful … but I was more occupied by the fact she once again turned on the camera, taking our pictures. “Let’s make it a better pose,” I said as I removed her skirt. With only her stockings and garter belt on, her face still stained, she looked spectacular. </p><p>I pushed inside her slowly. She moaned and trembled as her body parted for my invasion, but she still took a number of photos without a break. </p><p>“You’re a very good photographer,” I said even as I tightened my grip on her thighs, parting her legs wide. “Now, let’s give you a worthy pose.” </p><p>I had been planning to take it slow, but her moans left no doubt that, at this point, she preferred something more exciting. I started to impale her repeatedly, her voice filling the room. “Faster,” she moaned. </p><p>“As you wish,” I said as I pulled out for a moment, just enough to throw her on the bed face first, then I took her prone body from behind even as I took her phone with one hand, and grabbed her hair with the other. “Smile for the camera,” I said as I took another photo. </p><p>“I look so…” she whispered, horrified yet fascinated at the same time. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I completed even as I pulled her hair back, happy with the role reversal. As much as I liked her teasing, I had to admit, I was far more partial to being the controller. </p><p>She moaned as I invaded her repeatedly, but even with the pleasure invading her, she managed to change her pose. Soon, she was on all fours, her tits dancing with each push, which created far better photos. I let her hair go and focused on her breasts, squeezing them while destroying their perfect rhythm. </p><p>She just moaned. </p><p>“Give me an even better expression,” I said as I flipped her once more. She lay on her back, her legs wide open invitingly. I slid in. “Play with your tits, I want to see passion and joy,” I ordered, finally acting like a proper photographer and asking for the poses I wanted. </p><p>She might have reacted that negatively earlier, but lost in the throes of passion, her only reaction was to moan louder. I took more photos in a frenzy,  matching the passion she displayed as she mauled her breasts. </p><p>It didn’t take long for her to climax again, but I continued impaling her, not giving her a moment to recover. </p><p>After all, multiple orgasms were a much better reward than a few photos. “It feels amazing,” she moaned as she abandoned herself to pleasure. Minutes passed, but when she tightened around me once more, I was at my limit as well. </p><p>I pulled out at the last second, covering her stomach and her tits with my seed to match her face. She just lay there, lost in pleasure. After multiple orgasms, it was a miracle she was conscious, so I didn’t tease her about that. </p><p>She did look amazing in the pictures. </p><p>Working with her was going to be fun…</p>",

    "content": "<p>“How about you take a couple photos of me,” she whispered as she passed her phone to me. </p><p>“Oh, what an excellent idea,” I said. It was true. Taking photos of a sexy busty blonde was hardly a chore even under ordinary circumstances, let alone when she had just done me a huge favor.</p><p>A favor that might be the distinction between life and death. </p><p>“Let’s start with something simple,” I said even as I pushed her to her back, which parted her already loose bathrobe open, giving me a glimpse of her breasts. Her blush as she covered her breasts was spectacular, though she wasn’t quick enough to prevent the revealing first pose. </p><p>“H-hey,” she protested, but her voice was mellow. More importantly, that was the extent of her protest as she posed for me, jumping at the opportunity to play along. I took several more photos without giving any directions. Not because she wouldn’t have followed them, but because she was doing rather well even without my intervention. </p><p>I didn’t need to say anything when her arm ‘accidentally’ slipped a few times to give me a glimpse of her nipples, rock hard with arousal. </p><p>I would have pushed forward, if it wasn’t for the interesting nature of her gaze. There was arousal, but also the fragility of a wounded gazelle, panic not far away. The moment I did something more than she was ready for, she would close off. </p><p>An interesting contrast, one that I would have played along even if her actions hadn’t been fun. She deserved a reward after enabling me to use the laser cannon even if I had to play the role of a bored cameraman.  </p><p>Luckily, that was not a concern considering she already stood up a minute later, moving through poses of increasing sexiness while her robe parted wider and wider, barely keeping her wonders hidden. </p><p>My gaze danced over her flushed skin even as she moved around the room. “Maybe I should try some outfits, since I have a cameraman,” she whispered. </p><p>“Excellent idea,” I said, watching as her hips swayed while she went to her wardrobe — quite large thanks to her hobby. Its doors were large enough to keep her hidden while she changed, yet she still gave me occasional ‘accidental’ glimpses. </p><p>“How do I look?” she asked when she finally stepped back. </p><p>My eyes widened. “Exquisite,” I murmured even as my gaze danced on her body, taking note of her outfit. She wore a simple sundress, which was supposed to be a conservative piece … if it was worn by someone three inches shorter, not to mention with a more modest bust and hip size. On her, it looked simply obscene, and her obvious lack of underwear didn’t help. </p><p>Her breasts looked like they would pop out at the slightest sharp movement, and the skirt was short enough to display her legs perfectly. “How about we start slow,” she said as she took a pose. </p><p>My technical knowledge when it came to photography started and ended with pressing the button, but I was far more familiar with the concept of sexiness. Also, my power helped me somewhat, so I thought the photos were coming out nicely. </p><p>Then, Emily leaned forward, giving me an excessive show of her cleavage, and I stopped caring about the quality of the photos. She twirled, leaned, and danced, all giving me some good photos and even more excellent memories. </p><p>More importantly, the more she posed in front of me, the more aroused she was getting. I could see her having an inner conflict about whether to stop or continue … and the more I didn’t push, the more she was leaning toward the latter.  </p><p>She disappeared behind the wardrobe door once again. “You’re not getting bored, are you?” she asked throatily. “We can always stop if you get bored.” However, from the way she asked that question, I could sense her conflict. She would stop the show if I answered her too enthusiastically. </p><p>“Nonsense, I owe you for your help. I’m under your command,” I said. I deliberately kept the reply the innocent, and only my throaty tone suggested more. </p><p>She didn’t answer, frustrated by the answer slightly. Yet, that frustration didn’t prevent her from stepping into the room, wearing a different outfit. This time, she didn’t neglect underwear, but considering she was wearing only a tiny skirt and no shirt, it wasn’t exactly a loss. </p><p>Her black and lacy bra was barely enough to cover her breasts while her skirt functioned more as a belt. Yet, the matching black stockings and garter belt looked amazing. It was a beautiful sight. </p><p>Brave as well, though considering the way she blushed, I could see that she was pushing her limits. “How about a new photo,” she said as she put a leg on a chair, giving a daring pose. </p><p>“You’re the boss,” I said with a gentle smile, letting her act as she wanted. She clearly enjoyed the showing off, but was hesitant for any kind of extra intimacy. So, we took several more photos, before she dared to walk near enough that I could pull her closer, the way she was leaning elevating her already impressive bosom to the level of a goddess, making my pants uncomfortably tight. </p><p>Patience, I repeated. Only the clues from my powers telling me that the night would be over if I reached to grab her kept me close. Instead, I took several more amazing photos, while getting closer and closer.</p><p>Her hot breath danced on my skin invitingly, one I would have taken in a heartbeat if it wasn’t for my power telling me it was a fake invite. Yet, the more I refused the obvious call, the more aroused she got.  </p><p>What a complicated woman. Luckily for her, even without her power to sweeten the pot, she was beautiful enough to be worth the trouble. </p><p>Also, I was curious just how far she would push in her attempts to trip me. </p><p>“Why don’t you help me to remove this bra so we can take some better photos,” she suggested as she turned her back, but the way she bent forward to reveal her full ass was tempting enough to seriously challenge me. </p><p>Especially since she was wearing a g-string underneath. </p><p>“Well, don’t blame me if I lose control,” I whispered, my hot breath caressing her ear, but despite my words, I barely touched her as I unhooked her bra, surprising her. </p><p>“Good that you can keep your hands to yourself,” she commented, but the edge in her playful giggle contrasted her words. Or, the speed her bra landed on the ground. When she turned to face me, I could see that her determination to avoid physical closeness was getting weaker. I could lean forward to capture her lips — or better, her nipples — and all I would receive was a half-hearted push before she ‘accepted’ the change.  </p><p>After being teased for so long, I had a different plan in mind. I leaned forward, close enough that she felt my breath on her hardening nipples, but rather than continuing, I fixed her skirt and took a step back. “Now, give me another pose,” I said. </p><p>She looked shocked, but I didn’t bother hiding my playful grin, signaling that the game had changed. “Oh, that’s how you want to play,” she gasped. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” I said, deliberately lying terribly. </p><p>“Very well,” she said. ”You want interesting poses, right,” she said as her hands disappeared under her skirt, and pushed her panties down. </p><p>I expected her to react like that, but even with my power, the speed of it surprised me. Her fingers disappeared under her skirt almost instantly, her legs open. “How about this?” she asked.</p><p>“Amazing,” I said as I devoured the dance of her breasts. “Why don’t you use the bed. I’m sure it’ll be more comfortable.” </p><p>“What a nice suggestion,” she said, but to my surprise, rather than walking there, she fell on all fours, and slowly crawled toward her destination, her skirt had been dislodged enough to give me the perfect show. </p><p>She crawled to the edge of the bed, but rather than climbing on, she leaned against it, her legs wide open. One of her hands landed on her breast, and the other stayed between her legs as she started playing with herself with a fascinating rapidness. </p><p>Delicious indeed. </p><p>“How about this pose,” she asked between moans. </p><p>“Something is missing,” I said. She smiled. “Maybe a toy,” I added, and that turned into a frown. It was only momentarily, lasting until I pushed my pants down and revealed my erection. “How about this?” I asked. </p><p>“Well, barely enough,” she said, but her hungry tone betrayed her true feelings.  </p><p>Warmup was over… </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>As I rushed toward the fire tower, I didn’t neglect creating a small mana subdimension for my three goddess, linking directly with the Primordial Aether to provide them with more mana than they could control. </p><p>It was needed, as once we dealt with the ambush, the undead responded with more force. I could count more than a hundred avatars surrounding them, and at least three gods that approached them. </p><p>And, that was their share. An even bigger force was moving toward the tower of fire, mixing with the other members of the Eternals. I was so lucky that the majority of the Eternals were actually escaping the battle, some feeling strong enough to be a serious threat. </p><p>With the System unreachable, their courage faltered significantly. I didn’t sympathize with them, as every single one of them had some kind of Divine Spark, and they could have easily fought against the tide. Instead, they relied on their disposable undead underlings while they chose to stay in their estates, which allowed the elementals to penetrate the city far more. </p><p>It was hard to pity them, when they let monsters kill people for hundreds of years just to speed up Divine Spark generation. </p><p>I slowed down to keep my approach concealed, as a considerable number of Eternal warriors and mages surrounded the place, ready to act. Luckily, behind me, the battlefield was getting more heated as the girls put their infinite mana to good use. </p><p>Mariel took the point, using her aggressive light attacks to vaporize the strong undead that could threaten them with precision, while Marianne’s unique spark was perfect for area effect, dealing with the weaker horde. </p><p>This left Seldanna free to grow a shocking number of treants that she sent forward wave after wave, countering the enemy’s number advantage while also entangling any Eternal that wanted to join the mess to support the undead. </p><p>Three of them made an excellent anti-undead army. </p><p>Sometimes, I loved my luck. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with my luck, pushing through the army that was trying to cut through the fire elementals that tried to defend the tower wasn’t easy. Though, as I moved forward, an Eternal flew back, bisected. I checked his trajectory, and at his start point, I found a familiar figure. </p><p>Aviada. </p><p>She changed during her long absence but also stayed the same. Her shiny black hair was longer and gathered to a braid, and she wore a full plate armor that was made the same style as Marianne’s, but otherwise, she was the same. At least, physically. </p><p>She still had her family sword, but it was glowing with some kind of mysterious inner fire, every swing enough to take down an Eternal. </p><p>We had clearly underestimated the potential of her sword. It had some kind of Divine Spark inherent to its metal. It was hard to define, but Sword Spark wasn’t a bad definition. Maybe Cutting Spark would be more accurate. </p><p>It didn’t just cut physical stuff. Every swing of her cut even magic, no matter how strong. Truly a fascinating weapon. </p><p>It even had its own domain. Fairly small, but robust enough to cut any other domain that was trying to push against hers. </p><p>To make her even more dangerous, she had her own spark empowering her. It was harder to detect, but it felt more like some kind of physical improvement, mostly Strength and Agility with a sprinkle of Speed, allowing her to move far faster even though she was merely a pseudo-goddess. </p><p>A devastating combination. </p><p>I wanted to talk with her, but unfortunately, that was not exactly possible. Instead, I moved slightly away from the battlefield, and summoned Oeyne’s avatar while communicating with her. </p><p>“It’s a mess in here,” Oeyne said the moment she appeared. </p><p>“I need you to support Aviada,” I asked. There was a reason I left Oeyne out of the anti-undead team, even though her abilities would mix excellently to empower the treants Seldanna was growing. </p><p>Aviada trusted Oeyne. After all, she was the one who introduced me to Oeyne in the first place. </p><p>“It looks like a mess,” Oeyne said, but she didn’t ask any more questions. She knew that it was a dangerous situation. </p><p>I needed to help her a bit more. I cast a spell to pull any metal that was currently discarded and ownerless to her, and at the same time, created a defensive position with her with its own forge. “Create confusion,” I asked her.</p><p>A goddess of the Forge was not exactly the ideal combatant, but with the defenses I created for her, and Aviada’s help to harry any dedicated attacker, she could provide some valuable distraction. And, even if she failed, she was only here as an avatar. </p><p>A defeat might be crippling to any other goddess, but as long as we were victorious, I could help her absorb more Spark. </p><p>I didn’t stay helping her communicate with Aviada. I didn’t trust Aviada … well, I trusted her to help me and not attack me. I just didn’t trust her to hide her reaction to my presence, or not to alert the whole enemy army to my presence due to sheer surprise. </p><p>She had always been excitable and aggressive, and expecting that to get somehow more manageable after the clear power-up she managed to gain… No, that would be stupid. Instead, I stayed at the corner, watching her battle against some of the other threats while Oeyne rapidly forged several golems, her divine domain making it far easier. </p><p>It wasn’t the most ideal way of using mana on the battlefield, but I couldn’t afford to summon Helga. </p><p>She still needed to discover the real core of the System, a task she was uniquely suited for. </p><p>Aviada confirmed the accuracy of my guess soon enough when the golems started marching. “Oeyne,” she declared happily the moment she noticed her presence, not noticing the potential additional risk she had exposed Oeyne. </p><p>I vaguely felt a sense of disapproval from her sword. It was subtle, but I didn’t think that it was just an illusion. </p><p>However, while the possibly-sentient nature of her sword was important, it wasn’t urgent. So, I ignored it as I carefully floated closer to the tower. Bypassing the Eternal army was easy, especially when they started to pay too much attention to Aviada and Oeyne. </p><p>The elementals were more of a challenge, but my extended experience with fire magics helped there. I pulled the flames around me, and with a layer of darkness magic underneath. Combined, I registered as an elemental to their mindless rage. </p><p>And, they lacked the intelligence to question why one of their members had been rushing to the opposite side of their mindless rush, toward the tower. </p><p>Of course, while it was a simple trick, it was certainly not easy. Elemental flame was a completely different challenge than ordinary fire magic, and without my ridiculous stats, I could never control them directly. </p><p>Using them to attack my enemies would have been easy … but controlling them tightly enough that they wouldn’t touch the darkness layer underneath while letting them burn outward freely was much more difficult. </p><p>Pure elements were strong enough to burn through magic if touched, so I couldn’t just ward it. Any ward that was strong enough to actually block the flames would alert both the elementals and the Eternals to my presence, ruining the whole point of stealth. </p><p>But, after my recent improvements, it worked perfectly. Combined with Aviada’s distraction, I arrived at the tower. </p><p>The tower itself was the most marvelous magic object I had ever seen. Too bad it was completely shattered as the elemental lord it was supposed to be containing raged. I climbed, only to see one of the most amazing, yet scariest sights I had ever seen. </p><p>Cornelia, naked as the day she was born, wrapped in flames. Her eyes were closed and she looked frozen, the flames actually invading her. </p><p>I prepared to interfere. Whatever that was going on, it was not good news. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 190    Charisma: 190</p><p>Precision: 190    Perception: 204</p><p>Agility: 190     Manipulation: 201</p><p>Speed: 190       Intelligence: 254</p><p>Endurance: 268      Wisdom: 230}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 913,221}</p><p>{Divine Air Spark: 32,193}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge</p><p>Goddess of Healing}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Annoyance and relief battled in me as I watched Marianne attack the undead with a confidence that shocked me. </p><p>As she raised her hand, modified life magic radiated, countering and destroying the necrotic energy it touched, even more effective than my own modified light-life attack. She wore shiny armor, and her blonde hair danced in a way that made my blood move faster. She looked good. </p><p>More importantly, I could see her domain trying to establish itself, showing that her absence had been productive. I would have been surprised, but the timing of her attack made it obvious that it was the mysterious actor behind my unique System that helped her. Otherwise, there was no chance she could absorb her unique Divinity in such a short time. </p><p>Just not as strong as she would have developed with my help. </p><p>Seeing her alive and thriving was a beautiful surprise, but most of the relief was negated by the inconvenient presence of her attack. I could see her rushing into the endless undead army recklessly, which put her in a perilous position. </p><p>Her presence ruined my plan to slowly sneak in and find the center while Helga worked to discover the core of the System. I couldn’t just abandon her to certain death. I could see avatars of eight undead gods closing in, accompanied by the real body of one, ready to surround her, hidden away from her detection. </p><p>I pulled the darkness around me tighter to stay hidden as I rushed forward, glad for the recent acquisition of Air Spark, which helped me to enhance my speed even further. First, I needed to break her from the trap before they took action. </p><p>There was one thing to my advantage. Once detected, an ambush was more of a danger to the undead. In an effort to keep their ambush hidden from Marianne, none of them had started pushing their domain. Admittedly, it was not a bad strategy. If it wasn’t for my most recent improvement in Perception, along with my magic expertise, I would have missed their presence in the undead mass. </p><p>Unfortunately — for them — the battlefield was an unforgiving place. Without the domain, they were vulnerable, and with their focus on Marianne, the sole god with his real body — a lich wearing some kind of crown — noticed my presence only when I put my hand on his skull. </p><p>Too late. </p><p>He tried to establish his domain, but I flooded his body with enough of my unique brand of mana to break down his Divine Spark. </p><p>Unfortunately, even when ambushed, taking down an actual god took some time and most of my attention. I couldn’t succeed if the other eight avatars attacked me at the same time.  </p><p>“Marianne, now, attack with your full power,” I shouted even as I stretched my mana. She looked at me, shocked, but quick to recognize me once my mana touched her, and a connection bloomed between us, using the remnant old connection from the System. </p><p>She could have easily broken that connection as a Divine Being, but instead, she strengthened it, her face blooming with a big smile as she recognized me despite my disguise. And, I used that to block the other connection she had with the System before the mysterious connection could catch onto it. </p><p>Another task that was only possible because of her trust. It would have been an impossible task if she tried to defend that connection with the System. </p><p>I didn’t snap the connection completely, but let it carry a bunch of fake information. At the same time, I used our connection to send an incredible amount of mana toward her. Not just pure mana, but most of my Pseudo-HP I stored. </p><p>“Thanks, honey,” she said as the mana flooded her, which she channeled into her domain. Pseudo-HP was even easier for her to convert to an attack with her own unique brand of Divine Spark. A glow covered the battlefield, targeting eight avatars at the same time, forcing them to deploy their own domains defensively. </p><p>And, gave me the time to drain the undead god that was supposed to be resurrected infinitely. </p><p>[+6,291,192 Purified Spark]</p><p>“Excellent work, my love,” I said even as I dumped all of it into my stats, improving myself even further. The exponential nature of the growth weakened the potential of the improvement somewhat, but every bit counted. </p><p>[+20 All Stats]</p><p>[-5,820,700 Purified Spark]</p><p>“My pleasure,” Marianne said as she continued to attack the avatars, preventing them from establishing their domains, and looking amazing while she did so. And, without their domains, they were even weaker to my attacks. </p><p>In the process, I created several large crystals glowing with an ominous dark purple color, making it look like I was capturing their Spark rather than devouring them wholesale. It was one secret I had no intention to reveal, even when my power was increasing greatly.  </p><p>[+3,248,300 Purified Spark]</p><p>[+10 All Stats]</p><p>[-3,441,850 Purified Spark]</p><p>“I’m so glad you’re alive, my love,” Marianne said after we dealt with enough undead to give her a chance to establish her domain. </p><p>“Me too, but what are you doing here?” I asked. </p><p>“We’re trying to help Cornelia,” she said proudly. </p><p>“What’s wrong with her?” I asked. </p><p>“She’s having some complications with her Divine Spark, and the solution is here,” Marianne explained. “So, when the System alerted us to the possibility, we decided to act …” she said. Just as she spoke, the defensive barrier of the city trembled, as one of the corners of the defensive barriers shattered. </p><p>The corner that was being held by the Fire Elemental. </p><p>“That’s what’ll help Cornelia, right?” I asked even with a sinking feeling. It was clearly a trap, but once again, I was slower to react. Another step in the System’s plan, one that forced me to avoid the mess even more. “Who’s we?” I asked. </p><p>“Aviada, of course,” Marianne answered. “She’s the one that helped us escape from the main material plane.” </p><p>“Very good,” I said as I looked around, watching as the eternal army tried to react to the sudden changes in the battlefield, trying to adapt to intensifying elemental attacks. Fire elementals, in particular, were having a far easier time penetrating. “I need to continue distracting them while I go and help Cordelia,” I said, and cast a spell. </p><p>It was a beacon, one that contacted Seldanna and Mariel, summoning their avatars to my side. At my right, light started to gather to form a winged being, shadows creating accents. At my right, flowers bloomed, quickly gathering into a humanoid figure. </p><p>I used a lot of mana to help them summon their avatars, but even then, it was a slow process. I just reduced it to a minute rather than hours. </p><p>“What’s going on —” Marianne said as she looked at the two gathering avatars, surprised, but before she could say anything else, I took a step forward, kissing her. She was quick to respond, and used the proximity to flood her soul with my mana, helping her to bond with her Divine Spark better. </p><p>Thankfully, our emotional closeness meant that Marianne accepted that without asking any question rather than resisting and slowing down the process. My increased stats made the process even stronger. </p><p>However, as I felt Marianne’s lips over mine, I care less about that. Instead, I raised a shadow barrier to block us from the view, and pressed her armor. It had an automatic removal spell, which required a unique spell to trigger, which worked as a lock. </p><p>Armor fell, revealing her beautiful body wearing just a corset, which I pulled down to grab her beautiful breasts. “I missed those,” I said even as I squeezed them, making her moan. Not seemingly appropriate in the midst of a battle, but the pleasure made her soul even more malleable to my intervention, quickening the process of her power up. </p><p>However, the similarities between her Divine Spark and Mariel’s played quite a role in the speed of my achievement as well. Otherwise, even with my advantages, I couldn’t squeeze the process into a minute. </p><p>I played with her body, not because of the pleasure it granted me — well, not only that, at least, as I truly missed my curvy healer — but because I needed every help I could find. </p><p>Luckily, it was something I enjoyed immensely. </p><p>“And I missed your massages,” she moaned as I twisted her nipples. “But why is my Domain getting far stronger.” </p><p>“A gift, of course,” I said as I pulled back, and put the armor back on. She looked disappointed. Frankly, I was as well, but there were more urgent things we had to deal with. And, now that our connection recovered once more, I was not afraid of not finding her once more. </p><p>The magical block that was keeping us hidden from the battlefield fell, and Marianne came face to face with Mariel and Seldanna. “H-headmistress,” Marianne gasped. </p><p>Mariel’s smirk was visible even under the circumstances. “Marianne, this is Seldanna,” I said as I pointed at the flower avatar. </p><p>“A - a pleasure,” Marianne said, still looking surprised. </p><p>“Your powers combine perfectly to deal with the undead. I want you three to cut through the undead army and in general be a nuisance, but stay at the edge,” I said, ignoring my desire to introduce the three in a far more familiar manner. Unfortunately, Cornelia’s situation was too dangerous to be delayed, so I had to leave that for the future. </p><p>“But, we need to march at the center to save Cornelia—” Marianne started, but I cut her argument off with a gesture. </p><p>“No, I’ll handle that, I promise,” I said. She looked unwilling, but she still nodded, trusting me to handle it. </p><p>I was glad for that, because controlling a rebellious goddess would have been a very troubling challenge. </p><p>With that, I departed. I had an angry goddess of fire to save. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 190    Charisma: 190</p><p>Precision: 190    Perception: 204</p><p>Agility: 190     Manipulation: 201</p><p>Speed: 190       Intelligence: 254</p><p>Endurance: 268      Wisdom: 230}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 913,221}</p><p>{Divine Air Spark: 32,193}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge</p><p>Goddess of Healing}</p>",

    "content": "<p>“You’re a smug little man, aren’t you,” Elsana growled as she fed me another flame essence pill, leaving little doubt about how she was planning to deal with her growing frustration. </p><p>I kept my mouth shut, not wanting to ruin the mood even as she pushed me to the bed, surprisingly forceful as she pinned me down and ripped off my clothes. Whatever that note contained clearly left her extremely annoyed, and her inability to trip me up during the massage added a unique class of frustration. </p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want me to continue with the massage, Master Elsana?” I said, unable to hide the amusement in my tone as she positioned herself above me, but yet to push down. She was even more aggressive than I expected, her usual calm nowhere to be seen. </p><p>“Take care of your tone,” she countered sharply, followed by a dark smirk. “Or better, let’s keep you silent,” she said as she brought herself up, and landed on my face. </p><p>Her tone implied that it was something degrading. Well, if it was, it wouldn’t be too shocking. I had been in this new world enough to learn that the connotations between sex and power were even stronger than back on Earth. And, even back then, there were some idiots who claimed that giving a woman oral somehow turned them into so-called beta males or other such nonsense. </p><p>It was ironic when their bored and unsatisfied wives visited me for some comfort… </p><p>I was very happy to teach Elsana that exact lesson. My tongue darted out, dancing at the entrance aggressively, her taste filled my mouth, and I disagreed completely. </p><p>Another part of the irony, is that the earlier massage lesson she had taught me to trip her up made the treatment even more effective. She moaned, even louder than I expected. “Y-you’re not bad doing that,” she whispered, trying to sound in control. </p><p>And failing. </p><p>I didn’t bother to answer as I let my tongue dance a while more, pushing her toward the edge, which had been even faster than I expected. Stress left her weak against the pleasure, especially after a long massage. </p><p>“May I suggest a little game, Master,” I whispered as I pulled back, just as she was about to reach to the edge. </p><p>“What kind of game,” she moaned. </p><p>“Well, you are stressed, especially after your best friend ignored your good intentions,” I said, shamelessly playing to their fight to distract her even more. Elsana growled, showing that I was on the right path. “I found out that trying to focus on something else helps anger.” </p><p>“You clearly have something specific in mind,” she said. </p><p>“Yes,” I said as I suddenly flipped and she ended up on her back, her legs still above my shoulders. It was still a dominant position, but not as dominant. She was already at the edge, which made women far more open to suggestions. “I found out that repeating something complicated helps like it gives out a sense of calm. Maybe, if you recite your refinement techniques and some recipes, it’ll help you forget your frustration.” </p><p>“You’ll learn it as well —” she started, but I chose that moment to give a lick, pushing her toward the edge once more. It was risky, but she was still feeling unbalanced from the fight with her friend, and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity. </p><p>“I’m flattered if you think I can learn advanced medicine recipes by listening only once, but…” I said, deliberately letting it linger with a sudden hint of despair, the implication being that if I had any kind of talent, my family would have nurtured me heavily rather than using me as a chip in their planned marriage alliance. </p><p>I noticed a thick layer of guilt on her face, which wasn’t too surprising. Ultimately, in this new world, I found myself in, not being able to practice high-level martial arts was a big shame for a member of a rich family, somewhat similar to failing to graduate high school. </p><p> Guilt was another useful tool I had used many times before, which resulted in new cars, designer clothes, and expensive watches … and now, it was giving me actual power. “A good idea. Let’s try it,” she said, quick to distract herself. </p><p>After all, for all intents and purposes, trying to learn something from such an unstructured lesson was supposed to be impossible. </p><p>It would require a miracle … or a very misguided divine punishment. </p><p>“Excellent, Master Elsana,” I said as I leaned forward, my tongue dancing at her entrance slowly to keep her at the edge while she started talking about various wondrous functions of her martial arts ability, and how it functioned with medicine refinement. </p><p>Even with my System-enhanced knowledge, I failed to understand most of the things she talked about, but it was a good sign. The better the lecture, the better the return. </p><p>I listened half-heartedly while my tongue danced at her entrance, determined to keep her at the edge as long as possible. None of her martial arts abilities mattered as I kept her on the edge, playing with her body like a musical instrument. </p><p>I kept my lips locked to her entrance, but my fingers started exploring her body, gently dragging over her breasts and teasing her nipples. A moan escaped her lips as I twisted her nipples gently, but the relief was still far away. </p><p>Still, I was careful. I didn’t let myself forget that Elsana was a dangerous woman even when naked. One wrong move, and the night would end up painfully. </p><p>Yet, it would be a lie to say that danger didn’t make the moment even more delicious. </p><p>“You’re doing excellent, Master,” I whispered, happy with the ambiguity hidden in the term. She raised her head, her blonde hair messy, her usual genial expression nowhere to be seen as she did her best to keep her moans back and continued speaking about medicine refinement. </p><p>I was glad that she was focusing on the medicine refinement rather than her unique Snow Blossom Martial art that supported her refinement. </p><p>Time passed. </p><p>“How about we try something more interesting, Master,,” I whispered almost an hour later when her pleasure had turned intoxicating without a climax. Yet, I had to admit, she resisted far better than I expected. She was even continuing to speak about her techniques, which turned into a wondrous treasure. </p><p>“What do you have in —” she started, which died the moment I moved up and positioned against her entrance, with her legs still on my shoulders, putting her in a challenging position. Yet, she was flexible enough to handle it. “Good idea,” she whispered throatily. </p><p>However unlike the rapid invasion she expected, I moved forward with a deliberate slowness. Her eyes widened in shock. “Oh, come on, Master. You were just telling me about the recipe for Skin Refinement Essence Pills. Why did you stop?” </p><p>“You’re playing a dangerous game,” she whispered, but no matter how dangerous her tone was, I ignored it as I kept moving back and forth at a torturous pace, still keeping her at the edge, the massage skills that she had taught me earlier proving to be the difference maker. </p><p>“Just continue talking. I love your voice,” I said as I leaned forward, kissing her neck. She grumbled, but continued talking about some of the tricks of Skin Refinement stage Essence pills. </p><p>Interrupted by a series of deep breaths she took to keep her moans down. Such stubbornness. </p><p>We continued for hours, turning the night into an excellent dance, testing several poses, until Elsana finally reached her limit. “Enough,” she growled as her legs wrapped around my waist and pulled me deep inside her. </p><p>“As you wish, Master,” I said with a chuckle and changed the pace. I stopped teasing her slowly, and started drilling into her mercilessly. Already at the edge, she climaxed immediately. </p><p>I didn’t give her even a moment to rest, and continued to impale her, curious how many repeats it would take to fuck her into the land of unconsciousness…  </p>",

    "content": "<p>I left my new residence at sunset — unfortunately without having some extracurricular fun, to both of our disappointment. I changed back into my expensive clothes and washed away the cosmetics. </p><p>Also, before leaving, I taught Pearyin a few basic takedown moves for her to practice along with a few more stances. In that, the other four martial arts I learned helped. Then, I gave her a detailed explanation of when and where to use the pills I left for her, along with strict instructions never to show those pills to anyone. </p><p>Then, I left her to practice the Forest Dance, my bastardized martial art. Forest Dance was still inferior to even the weak variants of the five martial arts schools, mostly because it lacked a concept to enhance the essence, but that was not a huge problem. I could always improve it in the future. </p><p>And even if that failed, it wasn’t a great harm. The System seemed to only care about the cultivation realm. As for Pearyin, being a substandard Muscle Reinforcement Martial Artist was still far better than anything else. </p><p>While thinking that, I managed to get near the compound, the darkness making it even easier to move around. The guards and servants were moving with a greater speed than I expected. Once I was sufficiently near, I appeared from a side street, making a show of trembling in fear. </p><p>“Great Scholar, you’re there,” said the first guard who noticed my presence and led me toward the compound. “Where were you?” </p><p>“I have been chased by a few persistent thieves, so I decided to stay hidden for a while,” I explained, feeling no need to shout about the suspected involvement of Lord Eirto with a random guard. </p><p> “A thief,” he said, looking surprised for a moment as he looked around. Then, he shook his head. “Doesn’t matter. Follow me. Master Elsana is concerned about your safety.” </p><p>“Thanks. It was a harrowing experience,” I said, sounding as cowardly and pitiful as I could manage. Even without the System, making others believe that I was able to escape due to pure luck rather than skill was to my benefit. As I walked, I occasionally looked around in a twitchy manner like I was afraid of others attacking, like my legs turned to jelly from the sudden turn of events. </p><p>It was a reasonable reaction for a man who had been pampered since childhood. </p><p>As I walked, I took note of the way people looked at me, taking note of who looked at me with disgust, and who looked at me with pity. The former, in particular, felt very important … if I could actually make them give me anything in an attempt to insult me. </p><p>Unfortunately, even with the high multiplier, it represented a niche source of income at best. </p><p>It was hard to convince people to give away valuable items as an insult. </p><p>In contrast, the ones that looked at me with pity were far more beneficial. If I was lucky enough, I might actually earn a few gifts from them. Some lessons about obscure topics were valuable, and so were the clothes and other knick knacks they might pass. </p><p>The Inventory feature was too useful during emergencies to be neglected. Having extra clothes, some extra equipment, and maybe even some higher quality cosmetics that I could use for better disguise, could prove critical to my survival. </p><p>Of course, that assumed there was neither a time limit, nor a capacity limit to Inventory … but that was a problem for another time.  </p><p>For the moment, I let the guard lead me to the same private garden, and both Lannayin and Elsana were there. Lannayin looked worried openly, and while Elsana tried to hide her expression, I caught the signs of distress in her eyes as well. </p><p>“I heard you had an adventure,” Elsana said. “It looks like you have another story to tell.” </p><p>“Not much of a one, I’m afraid,” I said with a dismissive shrug. “Just a bunch of thieves, though they were surprisingly persistent,” I said. </p><p>“They were not thieves. It must be Lord Eirto’s men. That guy is too persistent, and just because he has friends in the capital, he thinks himself to be untouchable.” </p><p>“Now, Lannayin—” Elsana started, trying to calm her down, but Lannayin ignored. </p><p>“Oh, come on. We both know what’s going on there!” </p><p>Elsana sighed. “Of course. I’m not a moron. But throwing accusations without evidence doesn’t help anyone. Eirto doesn’t leave evidence behind. Why else do you think they chose him to handle this mess,” Elsana explained. </p><p>I wondered exactly what was that mess, but I didn’t ask. I didn’t have the luxury of playing the local kingmaker, not with my far more urgent issues. </p><p>“You should have sent some bodyguards,” Lannayin said. </p><p>“What’s the point of saying that now,” Elsana said. “We haven’t considered the possibility, leading to this situation. We are going to be more careful the next time.” </p><p>They spoke over me, confident in their assumption that I couldn’t be trusted with my own safety. Considering only through my hard work in acting they believed that, I didn’t feel like complaining about the implicit insult. </p><p>Their discussion about my safety soon turned into various tricks Lord Eirto was pulling to further penetrate the town politically. I acted like any proper mistress or trophy wife should do, and just nodded while sipping my wine.</p><p>I tried to understand what was going on, but without knowing the names of the people they mentioned and the events they discussed, it was difficult to understand. I barely managed to compile a general sense of the issue. Eirto was rich enough to monopolize some of the trade channels, and the ones that he failed to monopolize were suffering through some unfortunate bandit and beast attacks. </p><p>It was suspicious, but I was more interested in the way they described the general dangers of traveling between cities. Apparently, there was a reason for the City Lord’s relatively high independence. Traveling between cities was even more dangerous than I had assumed, and they were separated by a great stretch of wilderness, filled with monsters and bandits alike. </p><p>Traveling alone was impossible for all but the strongest martial artists, and the closer the kingdom borders, the harder it got. An interesting situation. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was supposed to be a great traveler, which prevented me from asking follow-up questions. I busied myself with food and drinks.</p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 26, Pity Bonus - 5]</p><p>[31x Return - Flame Flicker Wine, Profound Medium-Grade]</p><p>However, seeing the drop in the cultivation difference bonus was annoying. The drop was lower than I feared, which was good, but it still represented a great loss of potential. </p><p>Unknowingly, Lord Eirto managed to deliver a blow against me. </p><p>While they were talking, a servant knocked on the door and burst in, her expression making it obvious that whatever happened was not good news. She passed Elsana a note. </p><p>Elsana read it, her general levity disappearing in an instant as she passed the note to Lannayin, who looked even angrier after reading it. “They are pushing their luck,” Lannayin growled in anger.  </p><p>“Maybe we should consider moving away,” Elsana whispered, too soft for me to hear if I were in Initiate Realm like I convinced them. “I’m sure another city will welcome the presence of two experts of our caliber.” </p><p>“No. Are you forgetting all the help she granted to us. We can’t just turn our back on her. Not now,” Lannayin answered, much louder. “Not after all the effort she put into blocking the others when we were weak. We owe her.  </p><p>Elsana sighed. “We don’t have the power to make a difference.” </p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” Lannayin growled as she stood up and walked away. She didn’t even bother to open the door, just kicked it away. </p><p>Elsana just sighed, showing that she was used to angry displays from her friend. I said nothing as I stood up as well, but instead of leaving, I poured her another glass of wine and started rubbing her shoulders. </p><p>She was tense. </p><p>The safer thing was to walk away without saying anything and let her anger fade, but their discussion implied that, soon, the city would get too dangerous for my taste. And, whether I stayed or left, the extra power would help. </p><p>“Feel free to tell me if I’m doing anything wrong,” I said. </p><p>“Bring your fingers higher. And be careful of the fourth acupuncture point, it’s too sensitive to to be manipulated directly …” she started, correcting my moves, her requests getting more and more demanding. </p><p>I recognized the pattern, as she was not the first rich and powerful woman I tried to keep happy. Sometimes, they dealt with other issues, and subconsciously wanted an excuse to blow up someone unrelated. Wrong order at the restaurant, a loud servant…</p><p>A masseuse that was unable to follow her demanding her extremely complicated requests…</p><p>Unfortunately for her, her subconscious attempts to trip me up failed spectacularly after her unintentionally complicated lesson. Instead, she was giving me a very advanced massage lesson, getting more and more complicated as she failed to trip me up even as the massage lasted almost an hour. </p><p>The best part, she was too frustrated to pay attention to notice that maybe I was a touch too skilled at massaging. Luckily, while essence massage was important, its real value came from actually helping people break through, which required Muscle Reinforcement Cultivation, which I kept hidden. </p><p>Coming from a master of her field, such a lesson was already valuable enough, but as she suddenly stopped with a beautiful growl that showed a different kind of frustration, I was happy to receive a shocking System return. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 26, Pampering Bonus - 51 (Capped)]</p><p>[77x Return - Essence Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity - Minor Accomplishment]</p><p>Talk about an unexpected reward.

    "content": "<p>I knocked on the door of the room, but there was no answer. I smiled as I knocked again, this time using a rhythm we agreed on previously. This time, the door cracked open, and Pearyin looked. “Who are you?” she asked. </p><p>I chuckled. “Don’t tell me that you don’t recognize your poor student,” I said. </p><p>She did a double-take. “Y-young master. Is this you?” </p><p>“It’s just a disguise,” I explained. After all, I was still dressed as the servant of a mysterious lord who visited the city to arrange some stuff. </p><p>“Everything is okay, right?” she said. </p><p>“Yes. I managed to rent a better house, so we’re going there,” I explained. I expected more questions, but she just went inside and packed her personal items, which took only seconds. A few minutes of travel, and we were in the new rental. </p><p>“Now, we still need to stay under the radar. Our enemies are still looking for me,” I said. Luckily, she was obedient — excessively so — and she didn’t need any further explanation. </p><p>“What do you need me to do, young master,” she said. </p><p>“You’re going to stay inside and practice martial arts. And, if there are any insistent visitors, send them away,” I said. “Now, show me your stance.” </p><p>She once again took the modified Aikido stance I had created. “Let’s make a few changes,” I said as I put my arm on her shoulder. “Loosen the muscle I’m touching. Shift your weight more toward your left leg, and tense your back muscles more,” I repeated, directly correcting her stance. </p><p>Compared to the previous training session, I had two advantages. First, I learned four new fighting arts. While the version I had learned was inferior to the Tiger Fist, it still gave me a better idea of how the martial arts actually worked. </p><p>I could have taught any one of them to Pearyin, and it would have been easier than my so-called Forest Dance Martial Arts, but that would mean she couldn’t explain the origin. Not to mention, there was a low-key civil war going on between the Martial Arts school, and I didn’t want to complicate it further. </p><p>The other advantage was the essence massage technique I had learned. Combined with my increased medicinal knowledge, I was able to manipulate her essence with shocking efficiency. </p><p>Half an hour of practice, and she suddenly froze. “I … I think I just had a breakthrough,” she whispered as she started sweating even more as her body started to dispel the impurities. </p><p>“Wait here,” I said as I went to the kitchen, and put a small plate of stew. Not because I was suddenly stingy, but because it was too intense for her to handle directly. “Eat,” I said as I put my hand on her stomach, using Volcano Essence to help her break down her food once more. </p><p>This time, it wasn’t as wasteful as the previous time. One benefit of my breakthrough, I was able to channel my essence out with higher efficiency. Also, I treated the meat with some Volcano Essence before to make it easier to digest as well. With my help, the small bowl of stew wasn’t any worse than a low-glade essence pill. </p><p>The essence spread into her body, and the depletion of the breakthrough was resolved. </p><p>“I … I’m a martial artist. I can’t believe it,” she whispered repeatedly. </p><p>“Don’t get excited, it’s just a start,” I said. “Now, go take a bath.” </p><p>She looked at me shyly. “Do … do you want to help me?” she asked shyly. </p><p>“Tempting, but I need to work on some other things first,” I said. The disappointed blush on her face was beautiful enough to make me regret that decision. Unfortunately, that regret didn’t make me change my mind. </p><p>I wasn’t exaggerating when I said I needed to work on other things. </p><p>While she was busy taking a bath, I went to the inner room where I set the cauldron, and started processing the herbs and the savage beast parts. My room wasn’t filled with Snow Essence, but that was not necessary for the essence pill I was trying to refine. </p><p>It was a weak pill, merely an essence recovery pill that was appropriate for the Initiate stage martial artists. I could have purchased a bunch for a few gold coins, but instead, I decided to practice my refinement skills. </p><p>I wanted to see how easily I could put the acquired abilities into play. It was better to know about it first. </p><p>The principles of the essence recovery pill were simple. Extract and purify the essence that was locked in the beast parts, mix it with various herbs that would control the release of the essence once swallowed, and a shell to maintain the locked essence. </p><p>Therefore, even the Initiate-level book I had received from the library had four variants of the recipe. The recipe I received from the System didn’t have the variants, but also it was better, meaning I could make several changes based on my relatively limited knowledge and the result still be acceptable. </p><p>First, I tried to refine one based on the booklet from the library. I prepared a portion of savage beast liver, and mixed it with four types of herbs while blasting certain parts with cold essence while the flame continued to dance underneath, allowing the various elements to mix. </p><p>Then, I added another batch of plants as I pulled the cauldron from the flame to lock down the medicinal properties, and blasted it with another burst of Snow Essence to shorten the process that should have lasted for an hour into seconds. </p><p>“Mortal Medium-Grade. Not bad,” I said as I examined the product. Seven, roughly round pills, each giving out a pleasing smell. </p><p>Technically, it was better than not bad. Far better. According to what I learned, an ordinary apothecary apprentice worked for years before they could successfully form even the lowest rank Mortal Low-Grade pills, and their success rate was worse than twenty percent.  </p><p>But, I was cheating, so it was hardly something to be proud of. </p><p>I refined three more sets based on the same recipe, two of them actually resulting in Mortal High-Grade pills. The Medium-Grade ones allowed me to profit at least a gold each, and the High-Grade ones at least tripled it. Maybe more if I could actually find the right customer. </p><p>The greatest difference between the Medium and High-Grade pills was not the total energy, but the purity. The purer they were, the less consequences there were for consuming several in quick succession. For Initiate Stage Martial Artists, High-Grade pills could easily double their practice time, making them valuable. </p><p>Of course, most martial artists didn’t have the luxury of consuming Essence Pills for training, and kept them for emergencies, relying on food to replenish their energies, which slowed down their breakthroughs even more. </p><p>Ultimately, while talent was important for the further stages, the lack of resources was the real challenge that kept Martial Artists back. </p><p>I wanted to see just how quickly Pearyin could go through with unlimited resources, endless essence massage,   </p><p>I quickly ate the High-Grade ones, using Volcano essence to break them down even more quickly and destroy the excess, replenishing the essence I lost during the earlier breakthrough, though the refinement process burned a decent amount as well. </p><p>The Medium-Grade ones, I just threw into a fancy box, like they were important resources. If a thief broke in, it would make a convincing decoy. </p><p>Then, I started refining another set of pills, this time using the recipe I received from the System, though half of the materials, I replaced with worse ones. Some herbs were rare enough that purchasing them would have been suspicious, while the others were simply now available in Markas. Therefore, the superiority of the System-Recipe was degraded significantly. </p><p>Therefore, I expected the result to be Mortal Peak-Grade, and Mortal High-Grade wouldn’t be too disappointing either. </p><p>So, when I looked at the results, I couldn’t help but gasp. </p><p>Profound Low-Quality. </p><p>“Damn, the System is not playing around,” I gasped as I popped one into my mouth, testing its smoothness. Even without the help of the Volcano essence, it melted in my mouth, spreading like a whisper. “I wonder for how much they could be sold.” </p><p>Probably at least twenty gold coins, maybe more … assuming I could find the right customer, of course. Its advantages were significant, but ultimately, no Initiate could pay for it by working. It was a true luxury product. They had to come from a rich family, and for them, reaching Muscle Reinforcement was not a challenge for anyone but the laziest and the least skilled. </p><p>Any apothecary skilled enough to refine basic essence pills to the Profound Grade would refine better pills. It was a better use of their time. </p><p>It was different for me. A few extra gold coins I could get from other medicines didn’t mean as much as improving Pearyin. The value of someone I could trust — within reasonable limits — was far more important. </p><p>With a determined expression, I threw another set of herbs into the cauldron, preparing to refine another set of Profound Low-Grade pills. After today’s encounter, I didn’t know when I would be able to leave the estate after today’s scare, and I wanted to leave enough resources for Pearyin to allow her to cultivate without a problem. </p><p><br></p>",

    "content": "<p>When I arrived at the guest room that was dedicated to me, the first thing I did was to check the walls to make sure there was no hidden watcher or something similar. Then, when I was convinced of my safety, I reached the System, and finally pulled one of the books I received. </p><p>The book on Tiger Fist. </p><p>I had two reasons for that. First, in an emergency, I could just throw it into the fireplace — which was raging to counter the intense cold that settled on the compound. I had another copy of it buried in the wilderness, so it wouldn’t be a big loss. </p><p>Also, I wanted to see how the difference between Profound Middle-Grade and Mortal Low-Grade when it came to the same art. Maybe there were fewer moves, or they had some mistakes? Or, maybe it was just harder to understand?  </p><p>As it turned out, none of these possibilities were the case. Not only did it contain the exact same move diagrams, but also it was followed by reasonable, easy-to-follow explanations that made it far easier to understand. Even with my talent, I was yet to decipher the other manual fully. The new book would barely take minutes to understand. </p><p>If it was my first day in this new world, and someone put the two manuals in front of me and picked one, I would have picked the one that was easier to understand. But, now, I was thinking that, maybe it was not just the tradition that made them write the other manual in complicated poems. </p><p>It would certainly explain why I felt the essence of Tiger Fist disciple in the arena was fraudulent. </p><p>Essence was truly a mysterious thing. </p><p>There was one benefit. It made them very easy to memorize — though I suspected my artificially induced martial art talent played a big role in it — so I pulled the other four books,  practiced their Initiate moves and their first move of Muscle Reinforcement, and memorized the rest. </p><p>And then, burned all of them. Valuable as they might be, they were too dangerous to bring around. </p><p>I didn’t practice them for long, and instead, I pulled the Initiate section of Snow Blossom Art and started reading it. It was more complex than the five books I had just burned, but it wasn’t as complex as the Hidden Tiger Fist manual. </p><p>Since Elsana was the one that allowed me to take it, I could study it openly. While the Initiate section was technically useless for anyone else, for me it had two advantages. First, it created a plausible excuse to ask some pointed questions to Elsana to leverage the System and turn them into super lessons. </p><p>Also, it would allow me to handle the Snow Essence much better … extending the duration of our fun without making her suspicious. </p><p>I kept the complete manual hidden for the moment. Since it was Peak-Mortal level, I was afraid it wouldn’t be as easy to memorize. I kept reading the book until right before noon, before I changed into a new set of clothes — my wardrobe was filled with an excessive amount of outfits tailored for my size, but none triggered the System — and left the compound. </p><p>I told the servants that I wanted to see the more of the city, and refused the offer of a carriage. Staying inside was safe, but I wanted to test and see if I could actually refine an essence pill. </p><p>The moment I left the compound, two people started following me. They were good enough that I wouldn’t have noticed them if I wasn’t looking for them. I wasn’t too alarmed by their presence, as not only did they maintain a stable distance, but also they paid more attention to my surroundings than me. </p><p>I assumed that they were bodyguards assigned by Elsana. </p><p>I could ditch them easily. All I needed was to take a sharp turn, ditch them, and change into another set of clothes from my Inventory. Unfortunately, it would be too suspicious to ditch them the moment I left the Estate, so I had to abort my desire to test my Apothecary skills. Instead, I would walk for an hour, maybe buy a few books, and then return to the estate. </p><p>It was a simple plan … so I was surprised when it hit to a sudden hitch. The first problem I noticed was my hidden escorts, blocked by four people wearing gray, ordinary clothes, and a broken vase on the ground. “How dare you bump into me. You’re going to pay for it,” the other party shouted loudly. Too loudly, like he was trying to convince the crowd. </p><p>It looked like a scam. Too much, even. Even before I noticed two people ignoring the commotion and walking toward me, I knew that it was a ploy to target me. </p><p>It looked like Lord Eirto, or his spoiled son, wasn’t willing to wait until I left the city. I acted like I hadn’t noticed my followers and continued to walk, then suddenly shouted while pointing to a blind alley. “Pickpocket!” </p><p>With that, I dashed into the alley at an ordinary pace, but the moment I was at the back alley, I started running much faster, relying on the nameless running technique I derived, even pushing the essence to my legs. </p><p>As I did so, I felt a mental barrier shatter. Another breakthrough brought me to the Intermediate Muscle Reinforcement realm. I bit my lips, trying to contain my desire to curse. The last thing I wanted was to have a breakthrough, but the sudden adrenaline rush still triggered it. Worse, I wasn’t even concerned about avoiding them. </p><p>Just like that, I had a permanent reduction in the rewards I could collect. What a pointless disaster.  </p><p>I still pulled a set of ordinary clothes from my inventory and changed into them, bundling my expensive clothes to bring with me. </p><p>“At least it gave me a chance to do some private shopping,” I said even as I pulled a Mortal Peak-Grade savage meat dish from my Inventory and ate it quickly. It was delicious enough to savor, but I devoured it quickly. </p><p>After the breakthrough, my essence was depleted, and I wanted to replenish it. </p><p>Secure and rejuvenated, I started thinking about what to do. I could return the estate safely … but I decided against it. Here, my established reputation as a coward worked to my benefit. No one would question when I said I was too scared to return immediately. </p><p>It might even make a few apprentices and servants pity me, which would be very useful when triggering the System. Particularly if I could swindle a few lessons on various topics in the process. </p><p>“But first, let’s put a better disguise,” I said even as I pulled a few ordinary grasses that grew on the roadside, their properties already clear to me. A flash of cold from my left hand, followed by a quick flash of heat from my right hand, turned into a powdery dust that could be used as a poor cosmetic product to change the color of my hair. </p><p>Apothecary knowledge was no joke. </p><p>What I did was extremely impressive, but also wasteful. The amount of essence I had consumed was hundreds of times more expensive than the value of the poorly made cosmetic I created. But, under the circumstances, I was very happy to make the exchange.  </p><p>Once I had changed my hair color, I started walking around the marketplace. I purchased a small cauldron, a mortar and pestle, and some common herbs that could be used to refine the lowest-grade essence pill. </p><p>The combined bill still hit above a hundred gold coins even though I purchased the cheaper options. Not the cheapest, but certainly not the expensive ones … there were some cauldrons that were being sold for tens of thousands of gold.</p><p>In addition, I purchased a saber. I wanted to practice Dragon Saber for a while, in case it turned useful. </p><p>During the purchases, I also bought some better cosmetics and clothes, changed my looks to act like some kind of steward, and rented a small house in the outer ring of the city — though close enough to the main road to be safe — for six months, implying that it was for the upcoming visit of the master of my family, and I was sent ahead to arrange everything.</p><p>It cost me another three hundred gold, but it was money well spent. With that, I had an actual bass in the town I could practice martial arts and medicine refinement. </p><p>I was tempted to add a forge as well, but I decided against it. It was too attention-grabbing. Instead, I purchased some cooking implements, purchased high quality savage beast meat, and used the cooking skills I had learned from Marana to start a nutritionist stew. </p><p>My cooking abilities were decent … but actually applying some apothecary techniques turned it into a masterpiece in terms of essence quality.  </p><p>It was valuable enough to tempt the thieves.  </p><p>Luckily, I had a loyal maid that wanted to protect all. With that, I started walking toward the inn where she resided. </p>",

    "content": "<p>After our fun ended, Elsana kicked me out of her bedroom unceremoniously, but I didn’t care about that. First, it wasn’t the first time I had to leave once the fun ended, and it was far better than being interrupted halfway. </p><p>Also, I had my rewards.  </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pampering Bonus - 55 (Capped)]</p><p>[85x Return - Massage Technique Lesson, Minor Familiarity - Major Accomplishment]</p><p>[85x Return - Essence Massage Technique Lesson, Beginner - Minor Familiarity]</p><p>[85x Return - Snow Blossom Essence]</p><p>I sank into the water, shivering despite the warmth. It had been fun, but her method of cultivation meant a lot of her cold essence had seeped into my body. I could have used Volcano Essence to destroy it but I let it stay. I had already pushed my luck with that to extend the duration of our fun. Any more, and she would start to get suspicious. </p><p>As for trying to use Snow Blossom Technique, that was even more dangerous. I was yet to trigger the rewards from the System. And, not all of them felt safe. </p><p>Instead, I relied on the warmth of the water to combat the cold while I considered the rewards I had just acquired. Snow Blossom Essence was probably a concentrated form of her essence, which I didn’t dare to trigger, afraid of turning into a popsicle. </p><p>The massage technique felt like the safer option. I triggered the ordinary variant first, and when the information settled in my brain comfortably. I spent a moment enjoying the difference in the information I had received compared to the earlier. Not only the techniques were more professional, but also included information about the usage of some supplementary tools like acupuncture needles, balms, and oils. </p><p>It indicated that the style of of the instructor was even more than I had assumed.</p><p>Also, the jump between Minor Familiarity and Minor Accomplishment was incredible.  </p><p>Curious, I triggered the other lesson, and information flooded my brain once more, this time teaching me how to help spread, mobilize, and channel the essence of the others. </p><p>For example, I could use the massage to draw out the cold energy that was infused to my body, fighting against my essence. I wanted to trigger the other reward I had received, about the lesson on Snow Blossom Technique, but the presence of Elsana in the other room kept me from doing so. </p><p>What if she felt the fluctuations. Instead, I settled on the bath and let the cold disappear slowly.</p><p>Then, I heard Lannayin shouting. It came from inside, but her voice was too muffled for me to hear it properly. </p><p>Still, it meant that Elsana was too distracted to notice anything, so I triggered the lessons one by one, both the essence technique and the medicinal knowledge. </p><p>Learning another way to manipulate essence was a wondrous feeling. The cold essence that was previously hostile turned obedient as I absorbed it into the small ball in my chest, its coldness fading against my hidden energy. </p><p>Snow Blossom Essence was similar to Volcano Essence in the manner it was completely useless before reaching Muscle Reinforcement and gaining the ability to push it externally. However, unlike Volcano Hammer, it wasn’t immediately deadly during its earlier stages, making it easier to cultivate. </p><p>It explained the great disparity of wealth between two friends despite both having lucrative careers. </p><p>I continued categorizing the knowledge. Just like Volcano Essence was used to break down its target, which was then shaped by constant hammering, Snow Essence was used to freeze certain parts of the energies in the plants, so that, during the refinement process, they were released in a certain sequence, enhancing the quality of the final product. </p><p>The contrast between cold and hot essences was interesting. They were not entirely opposites, but they still clashed hard. They could be used to eliminate each other, but it had to be done slowly. Trying to combine them might be deadly. </p><p>Even with my enhanced martial talent, I didn’t dare to experiment. </p><p>Instead, I waited in the bath, processing the more intricate parts of the knowledge I received, with a relaxed expression on my face. I never liked studying, so my new way of receiving information worked much better with my knowledge. </p><p>Already, I knew enough to diagnose some critical health problems. More importantly, I had enough knowledge to refine the basic essence pill, the recipe I received at the restaurant. Combined, I could easily make a living ...</p><p>But I wanted to stay longer, at least until Elsana and Lannayin started to get bored of my presence. </p><p>They were fun enough, and spending a few weeks here should be safe enough. Then, one day, I could just leave a letter explaining that I was summoned by my family, and disappear. </p><p>A knock had been heard on the door an hour later. “We have some clothes here, young master,” a male voice said. “Master Elsana invites you to the garden.” </p><p>“Very good. Leave them,” I said as I stood up. Once the servant left, I changed into the new set of clothes, which fitted me perfectly. </p><p>Unfortunately, there was no convenient notification this time, which suggested that she might need to be in the same room to trigger it. That, or she was not feeling any sense of pity after the adventure we shared. </p><p>Frankly, I preferred the letter to the former. It was easy to reawaken a sense of pity, but if proximity was a part of the deal, it was a serious limitation for the ways I could abuse the System. </p><p>Not that I had any right to complain with all that I had already received. I just needed to stick around for a couple weeks until I turned into a master of martial arts, as well as a skilled apothecary and forger. </p><p>And, meanwhile, maybe I could even decipher what the essence was. </p><p>Once I changed into my new clothes, I followed a servant, who brought me to a private garden, but she didn’t follow me. It was a beautiful garden, filled with trees and flowers, but I paid more attention to the two beauties in the garden. Elsana wore a long, flowing green dress that accented her cold beauty perfectly. Across her sat Lannayin, wearing her usual practical ensemble. </p><p>They both had wine glasses in hand, and their mellow expression suggested that it was a strong wine. “So, our exalted scholar is finally here,” Elsana said teasingly as I walked forward. </p><p>Linnayin said nothing to me, but looked expectantly as well. They were clearly looking to be entertained. I decided to fulfill that need. </p><p>”With eyes of frost, one draped in winter's gown; a diamond heart where icy whispers crown. The other burns, a flame in mortal guise; with lips like embers, fire in her eyes,” I read, once again putting my oratory capabilities to the limit. </p><p>“Impressive,” Elsana said, amused. She was clearly entertained by my choice of playing to the fences even after our ‘adventure’ earlier. She poured me a glass of wine, which was a great honor in the context, so I bowed slightly as I took it. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30, Pampering Bonus - 10]</p><p>[40x Return - Flame Flicker Wine, Profound High-Grade]</p><p>My smile grew further when the System graded the product. Not only did it show that the pampering effect could be triggered further even in more casual situations, but also she wanted to reinforce the warmth of my essence. </p><p>Signaling that there might be a repeat in the future. </p><p>Just like the previous feast, I alternated between reciting poems and telling stories to keep them entertained, though the amount of wine they drank played an even bigger role in their good mood. Moreover, this time, it wasn’t just Lannayin who was drinking recklessly but Elsana as well. She was much more relaxed in private. </p><p>I waited until they were properly sloshed to make a request. “It’s a pity I won’t be able to collect any new stories from Markas. Not after I accidentally insulted the father of your disciple,” I said, doing my best to act drunk as well. </p><p>“Ex-disciple,” Elsana answered. </p><p>“Ex or not, it’s still your fault,” Lannayin said. “But don’t worry about it. As long as you don’t leave the city, he won’t be able to do anything. He won’t dare to offend both of us,” she said as she slapped her chest. </p><p>“You mean I can walk around the city,” I asked excitedly. </p><p>“Of course. I guarantee it,” Lannayin declared. Elsana looked frustrated, but she nodded as well. “Now, to another story. Tell me what happened once you departed this Black Pearl…” </p><p>“As you wish,” I said, doing my best to sample as many food and drinks as possible since they were in a good mood. It was never too early to start preparing for an eventual departure. </p><p>“That’s enough for tonight,” Elsana decided at one moment, after they both drank enough to kill a large squad of hardened soldiers. She waved me away, which indicated there wouldn’t be any follow-up fun. </p><p>A pity … but then again, I had a lot of things to work on. </p>",

    "content": "<p>As expected, the bar didn’t have many customers after the attack. The small fry avoided the place completely, afraid of what might happen. </p><p>We still had several twitchy visitors, each low-ranking member from organizations big enough to care about the attack, but personally disposable enough that </p><p>It had been a nice test run. With Emily’s help, I was able to dig deeper into their backgrounds, giving me a chance to actually identify their actual operations and some other convenient details. I had yet to use any aggressively, as it was just a test run, but it was still helpful enough. </p><p>It was barely eleven when we had no other customers, so I decided to close the bar early. “Can you sand off the paint from the laser cannon before starting to clean,” I asked Tara, which was far easier with her power. </p><p>While she was busy with that, I went upstairs and changed once more. This time, my disguise included a large suitcase with a roller, enough to fit the laser cannon while making it easy to carry. Not the ideal method to carry something, but the best I had. </p><p>“Keep your phone on and charged, in case I call to alert you,” I said to Tara before I left through the tunnel. The cameras also had an alarm system, but I didn’t trust it to keep even a half-decent infiltrator out. </p><p>While I was passing through my office, I decided to take a million dollars from the safe — and wasn’t that a shocking amount — and put it in my luggage. After the attack, it was safer to shift some money away. Most, I planned to bury into several random hidden spots, trusting my powers to identify spots that would stay untouched, though a small portion was there to bribe and awe Emily, so that she would actually modify the laser cannon. </p><p>I needed some encouragement considering the source. </p><p>Technically, I could have hidden its origin since there was no news about Chrome Defender’s defeat, but that would be a stupid risk. She was the receptionist of the guild. Not to mention, her power made it very likely for her to discover something more suspicious.  </p><p>No, being honest — for a very stretched definition of it — was the better choice. </p><p>Even after setting several emergency points with cash and other valuables, I arrived at my destination before midnight. Emily opened the door, still wearing the bathrobe she shared photos of earlier, only for her eyes to widen when she noticed my large luggage. “That’s rather oversized for an overnight bag, isn’t it?” she said. </p><p>“Well, that’s something we need to talk about, actually. There’s a little … issue.” </p><p>“Come in,” she gasped as she took a step to the side. She was quick to panic, which, under different circumstances, would have been problematic. But, considering my aim was to manipulate her, it was a godsend. “What happened,” she asked. </p><p>“Let’s talk in your room,” I said as I brought the luggage inside. She walked next to me, her beautiful expression twisted. I used the opportunity to enjoy her beauty. The bathrobe looked good on her, especially since it was on the shorter side. </p><p>She clearly wore it after her selfies wearing it earned a lot of compliments from me. </p><p>Now, as she walked hurriedly in panic, it pulled even higher, giving a glimpse of her hips, high enough to show that she wasn’t wearing any underwear. I had to admit. She made a good choice not changing it. She had better clothes … but there was a certain charm in her short bathrobe when combined with her curvy body and her blonde hair. </p><p>She looked fascinating. </p><p>I wanted to push her against the wall and have my way with her, especially when she forgot to pay attention to her robe — which had been already strategically loosened when she opened the door to get my attention, but getting more revealing than she planned thanks to her distraction — but I decided against it. </p><p>It would be harder to convince her about the importance of my sudden distress if I spent an hour enjoying her soft tits. </p><p>“Tell me what’s going on,” she said as she took a deep breath. </p><p>“You remember how I accidentally got recruited by a villain,” I said. She nodded. “Well, apparently, while I was with you, our bar had been attacked by a hero.” She gasped. “A hero … from the New Giant Force,” I finished. </p><p>“Impossible, it would have been on the news,” she said in shock. </p><p>I put my finger on her lips, happy to see she still took direction well. “Not if they lost,” I said. </p><p>“Who was it?” </p><p>“Chrome Defender,” I said. “I have seen the video. He has lost handily.” </p><p>The moment I gave the name, Emily’s expression of incredulousness fell off. “Not a surprise,” she growled. I quirked my eyebrow. “Well, I don’t know his identity, but more than one support staff was complaining about how much of a diva he was being during the armor fitting and training.” </p><p>“An interesting situation,” I said. </p><p>“He’s a legacy,” she said with a dismissive wave. I looked at her questioningly, and she continued. “It means he’s likely has other family members that’s either hero, or backing the guild financially. So, they get to join as a hero.” </p><p>“Even if they are totally unqualified to be trusted with an expensive power armor.” </p><p>“Exactly,” she said with a jealous sigh. Understandable, considering she actually had a power that could be useful in a variety of ways, yet they merely used her as a receptionist. </p><p>I was happy with her reaction. It meant my job would be even easier. I didn’t say anything else, just opened the luggage and revealed the content. “Wow, he really lost, huh,” she said, immediately recognizing the laser cannon. “Why do you have it?” </p><p>“It’s the reason why I’m here,” I said. “The attack scared me, so I managed to convince them to give me the arm.” </p><p>“How?” she said. </p><p>“I might have implied that I knew a hacker that could turn this into a useful weapon,” I said, and her eyes widened. “Please, try it for me. With it, I can defend myself when the next attack comes. I don’t want to be killed by the villains.” </p><p>“Why the villains?” she asked. </p><p>“Watch this,” I said as I pulled my burner phone and passed it to her, which only had things that fitted my story in case she decided to poke. I pressed the play. “Watch where he’s aiming,” I said, slowing down and deliberately avoiding shouting at the warehouse. “That’s a hidden Syndicate base, but he deliberately avoided it. I’m afraid that they planned that together.” </p><p>“But …” she started, only to freeze. “Him being useless is one thing, but actually working together with the villains.” </p><p>“Well, you suspected he’s a rich kid, right. What if they got rich with the help of the Syndicate,” I said, followed by a long argument that I basically repeated the same argument again and again in slightly different words. </p><p>“Alright. I will try,” she said with a sigh, convinced, and I didn’t even offer her money. She put her hand on the laser cannon, only for her eyes to widen. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Nothing … well, nothing except whoever wrote this software is a moron,” she added. </p><p>“Do you know how to code?” I said. </p><p>“Not particularly. I just started learning,” she said. “But, I can understand how this device is supposed to work, and how software interacts with it. It works as well as a car with square tires. The code itself is not bad … just bland. The real problem is they have no idea about the capabilities of the device.” </p><p>I had a stray thought about why it might be the case, but I ignored it for the moment as I focused on the moment. </p><p>“Can you fix it so that I could use it?” I said, hiding my excitement when she nodded absentmindedly. The shopping trip earlier already showed that her powers were better than her guild had thought, but her quick nod suggested that it was even better than I had thought. </p><p>Especially since, I had no doubt that they had already taken some measures to protect their weapon to be used by the others. But, whatever those methods were, they were helpless against her direct touch. </p><p>What a dangerous application. Though, with both of us as examples, I couldn’t help but wonder how many people had ignored their potentially very dangerous power. </p><p>A shuddering thought. </p><p>“Well, I think I can set up a new controller and install it on your phone,” she started. “Luckily, the laser cannon has its own temporary power source, so you don’t have to plug it, but once it’s shot once, you have to keep it plugged for at least a day for it to recover, unless you have some kind of exotic reactor,” she explained. </p><p>“Can you add some limiter, so that I can take multiple weaker shots with it if needed,” I said. </p><p>“It’ll be harder,” she said.</p><p>I smiled even as I moved next to her, and put my hands on her shoulders, which pushed her bathrobe slightly to enhance her incredible cleavage even more. “Do that, and I’ll do anything you want,” I whispered. </p><p>“Anything?” she asked, the hitch in her tone as arousing as her erotic look. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Once I returned to the bar, I wanted nothing more than to use the tunnel and beat a hasty retreat. Unfortunately, the belief that there was a bigger villain behind me was the only thing that kept us safe. </p><p>My second option was to lock the door, go upstairs, crawl under my bed, and call the day off early. Unfortunately, that was not an option either. It would make us look weak, and we couldn’t afford it. </p><p>Even worse, I didn’t have the luxury of panicking in the safety of my own bar, because once I entered, I saw Tara looking at the wall with a blank look, processing the deadly encounter she had gone through. I couldn’t lose my mind when she needed my guidance. </p><p>I couldn’t afford Tara mentally drifting away. </p><p>“It was an incredible performance for your first real super battle,” I said as I walked toward her, my feet hitting the ground with a confidence I wasn’t feeling. She didn’t react immediately. I put my hands on her shoulders, massaging softly. </p><p>I chose not to use her submissive habits in that case. It would have probably allowed her to work more smoothly, but it would have pushed her trauma down as well. It was what I wanted. Instead, I continued massaging her, putting my power to good use to maintain the pace. </p><p>I didn’t even push for anything sexual. </p><p>And, once I was sure that nothing dangerous would happen, I turned my attention to the ripped arm of the power suit … which included the intact laser cannon that Chrome Defender had used to demolish a few buildings. </p><p>Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have any hope of using it, but I remembered Emily explaining how she was able to sneak into the locker room of the heroines to take a few photos. She was able to interface with the door directly by touching it, bypassing the security measures. I was sure that she could repeat the same for the laser weapon. </p><p>I just needed to find a way to conceal the origin of the laser cannon, which would depend on whether The New Giant Force wanted to popularize the battle or not. In an ideal world, they would definitely push the news to alert the other heroes about the potential danger we represented. </p><p>Yet, this was not an ideal world. They were selfish enough not to care about the other heroes, and I strongly suspected that there was some kind of alliance between them and the Syndicate. </p><p>The real question was whether there would be a follow attack with more heroes. Ironically, their possible collaboration with the Syndicate made that less likely. An attack from a new hero, even if he was a bit overgeared, was easy to explain. A bigger attack, or the presence of one of the A-listers, would inevitably draw more attention to the region. </p><p>And, the Syndicate clearly didn’t want that, or otherwise they wouldn’t have gone all that trouble to conceal the place as some kind of drug distribution center of a minor villain.   </p><p>I predicted that the next attack would be a villain attack to give them plausible deniability. It was why I wanted to open the bar, making it look like an attack from the biggest guild of the city didn’t faze us the slightest. </p><p>Giving me time to develop contingency plans. </p><p>“I … I did good, right,” Tara whispered after almost ten minutes of massaging. </p><p>“You were excellent. You took down a hero with training and better gear easily. I’m proud of you,” I said, focusing on the compliments to distract her from the fact that she had just fought against a hero, putting her firmly into the villain territory. </p><p>No matter how unfair it was. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” she said as she shifted, leaning against me. After a long pause, she whispered again, this time even faster. “Do I get a reward?” </p><p>“Good girls get rewards … and you have been a very good girl,” I whispered. “Do you have anything in mind?” I asked. </p><p>It took a while for her to answer. “N-no. Not yet,” she said. </p><p>“Why don’t I give you a bit of inspiration, then,” I said as I pushed her forward, against the closest table, and pulled her pants down. I needed to open the bar, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t afford to spend a few minutes having fun. “Fuck, you’re so tight,” I said as I slipped inside her. </p><p>“Always for you, sir,” she answered, her beautiful moan echoing loudly. </p><p>Once again, I was glad for my ability to read her reactions easily, which allowed me to invade her aggressively without holding back, trusting her powers to keep her safe. Her only reaction was to bring her hands back, silently begging me to tie her hands behind her. </p><p>Technically, she could rip those bindings easily, but she treated them as invincible, her moans gaining an ethereal quality.  </p><p>Another woman might have considered being bent and tied down in the middle of a bar for a quickie humiliating and degrading, but as she was slammed from behind, Tara’s moans made it clear that she didn’t share that opinion. </p><p>“Good. Then take it, and let it inspire you to what you want as a reward,” I said. “You’ll have the whole night.” </p><p>“Really, you’re going out, sir?” she said. </p><p>“Once we close the bar,” I said even as I continued to piston into her. “I want to visit a fence to see if we can somehow turn your acquisition into something useful,” I said. “You did good ripping that without damaging the laser cannon.” </p><p>“S-should I escort you, sir?” she asked. </p><p>“No. I don’t expect any attack, but we still can’t risk leaving the bar defenseless. My disguise will hold,” I explained instead. </p><p>She didn’t fight back against my arrangements, though I could see that she was unhappy with the risk I was taking so close to an attack. Unfortunately, it was inevitable. I wouldn’t have stepped into this high-stakes game if I understood the implications the day I opened my bar, but after everything happened, pushing forward was the safest choice. </p><p>Her unhappiness with my choice didn’t prevent her quick climax. A loud moan later, she started shuddering helplessly. </p><p>“It’s time to switch up,” I said as I pulled her down. Without her powers, she would have hit the floor painfully, but she balanced herself easily thanks to her powers. </p><p>She opened her mouth as I grabbed her beautiful brown locks and pulled her forward, her submissiveness once again showing itself. Beautiful, sexy, and obedient… She was a true treasure. </p><p>And, I pushed, once again enjoying parts of that treasure without restraint, glad that her power didn’t block her gag reflex. There was something to hearing her gag and gasp repeatedly, especially combined with her resistance to actual pain, giving me all the pleasure, with no risk of causing an accident. </p><p>Things were spectacular enough before my phone buzzed, and I received another show from Emily. This time, to my surprise, it was a video. She was in a bath, moving in a way that left no doubt about what was going on underneath the bubbles. I smiled as I enjoyed the occasional glimpses of her incredible bosom I got whenever she moved too high. </p><p>‘Taking a break,’ her message read. </p><p>‘Don’t take too long. Work hard, and I might visit you tonight for a reward,’ I said. </p><p>‘You’re the boss,’ she wrote, which was followed by another message. ‘Look, I’m already out.’ That message had another picture attached, one in which she wore a bathrobe. It looked amazing on her, particularly since she failed to tighten it, giving me a deep glimpse of cleavage. </p><p>My smile widened, not just at the show, but how quickly she accepted my visit. It looked like my gifts earlier worked well. </p><p>I considered informing her about the laser cannon I was going to ambush her with, but after putting some thought into it, I decided against it. She wasn’t as submissive as my sexy bodyguard, but she wasn’t particularly strong-willed either. </p><p>Face to face, I could counter her arguments much more easily despite asking her to jailbreak a weapon from her guild. </p><p>She sent another photo, I answered, then turned my attention back to Tara, and grabbed her head with both hands before I started pumping into her throat. After all, it was her reward, and it was unfair to neglect her for long. </p><p>I continued to invade her throat until her lack of breath strained her. “Tell me, sweetie. Do you want me to cum on your face, or your mouth,” I said once I pulled out. </p><p>“F-face,” she whispered shyly. The fact that she still maintained her shyness after everything made her even cuter. </p><p>“As you wish, my beautiful,” I said as I pushed her mouth once more, my invasion even more frantic as I pushed myself into the land of climax. I was at the edge when I pulled again. She coughed weakly, but said nothing as I exploded over her face, covering her beautiful face. </p><p>“You look amazing,” I said as I reached and untied her hands. “Now, go upstairs and prepare. We need to open the bar in five minutes,” I said. </p><p>While she dashed away, I grabbed the laser cannon. It was heavy, but thankfully, it wasn’t heavy enough that I couldn’t carry it. Just under sixty pounds. </p><p>Something I could use to defend the bar. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Umi left work early, a little mercy since it was her first day — after a lengthy stay in the bathroom, removing evidence of what had happened — while I finished both my lunch and my paperwork, leaving me nothing to do. </p><p>I decided to visit Natalie. After all, no matter what, she was still my boss, right?</p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as I walked to her room. Brenda was sitting in front of her office, fixing her nails. She greeted me with a pout. “First day with a new secretary, and you’re already neglecting me,” she complained playfully. </p><p>“Nonsense,” I said as I caressed her cheek. “Just give her a few days to settle, and then I’ll need your help as well.” </p><p>“Good,” she said. “She needs the help. It’s not even a full day, and she can barely walk.” </p><p>I chuckled at her enthusiasm. “So, is a boss lady in her office?” </p><p>“Yes, with strict instructions not to be disturbed,” Brenda said, matching my smirk. She knew how ineffective a statement like that would have been for me. I said nothing as I opened the door. </p><p>Natalie was on the couch, laying on her side, looking exhausted. Her eyes were firmly closed. “I said I don’t want any visitors,” she said, thinking it was Brenda. </p><p>“Even me,” I said. </p><p>Her eyes popped open immediately, with no little amount of panic … and anger. “Nathan,” she said, her voice showing the same conflict. </p><p>I might have thought of retreating if our balance of power wasn’t completely warped to my benefit, both in the office and in her home. Instead, I walked forward and sat in the seat she just emptied. “Tell me, beautiful. Why the anger?” </p><p>She let out a growl, but to my surprise, followed it by unzipping her skirt, letting it drop down. Hardly a punishment, as I looked at her mostly naked ass — the g-string she wore covered nothing — but to my surprise, I saw several red marks. </p><p>Ones that I didn’t make, yet she blamed me for it. </p><p>It took a few seconds to connect the dots. “Jenny?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, Jenny, my girlfriend, who was challenging enough to keep sated with her wild hormones, before an idiot decided to introduce her to bondage,” Natalie said, revealing the source of her anger. </p><p>“And, since she’s pregnant, you can’t even ask her to take turns,” I said with a chuckle. “Poor little girl.” </p><p>“Don’t laugh, and don’t mock me,” she growled, trying to look angry, but it made her look even cuter as she struggled to evoke her past aura of control … and fail spectacularly. </p><p>“Really, what would you do,” I said as I pulled her on my lap, though I made sure to do it gently so as not to hurt her more. She wasn’t exactly suffering in pain, but a little pampering wouldn’t be amiss. I texted Brenda to pick an ointment from the pharmacy before I turned my attention on her. </p><p>“Jerk,” she said, but she still leaned against my chest. After months of a tumultuous relationship, we were close in every way that counted, enough that she leaned against my chest for comfort. </p><p>However, as her grip tightened around me, I could feel that the issue with Jenny wasn’t the thing that actually bothered her. Her grip was too intense for that. After some thought, I realized exactly what she was concerned about, but I didn’t open my mouth until Brenda arrived to drop the ointment, smart enough not to make a comment about why Natalie was on my lap without a skirt while hugging me. </p><p>Smart. </p><p>Once I had it, Natalie said nothing, just lay on my lap obediently while I took a dab and started spreading the relaxing cream to her ass. She let out a relaxed sigh, even though I knew the pain wasn’t intense enough to earn that reaction. </p><p>She was clearly enjoying the comfort. “So, do you want me to visit tonight and help you sate your sexy pregnant girlfriend,” I said. </p><p>“Yes please,” she answered readily, not even bothering to deny needing my help on that subject. Yet, she was still tense, showing that she had yet to tell me what really bothered her. </p><p>I said nothing, knowing that, even now, her pride was strong enough to be troublesome if I approached the issue wrong. Though, admittedly, I couldn’t help but feel entertained. When I first started my little game, I didn’t imagine myself helping her with her emotional problems. </p><p>At least the view was still excellent. </p><p>Knowing she was weak against a good massage — a fact I had discovered quite a long time ago, and used to my benefit several times — I let my fingers drift down once I finished spreading ointment, and started massaging her thighs. </p><p>She said nothing while my fingers danced on her legs gently, trying to come up with a good way to start the conversation. “So, have you tried talking about what’s bothering you with Jenny?” I asked. </p><p>“Of course not,” she answered, her voice sharp and slippy, conveying her feeling that she didn’t want to talk about the topic in the slightest. “She’s already dealing with the pregnancy. How could I stress her further,” she said. </p><p>At least, she admitted that she had a problem, which was a step in the right direction. I took a deep breath, enjoying her frustrated grumble as much as I would enjoy a full success. It was progress. For a while more, I said nothing, enjoying the sight of her growing patch of wetness. </p><p>“How about you talk to me?” I said as I let my finger slip over her wetness, gently caressing it. </p><p>“What, so that you can mock me about my incompetence,” she said, though her tone made it clear that she wasn’t really concerned about that, but just lashing out. </p><p>Not something a behavior I would have found acceptable under ordinary circumstances, but after everything, she earned enough credit to be converted into mercy, so I decided to ask in a way she would have been more comfortable answering. “Well, how about this. Tell me what’s bothering you, and I’ll see if we can come to a deal. But believe me, it won’t be cheap.” </p><p>She didn’t answer immediately, but I could feel that she lost some of her tenseness. She was far more willing to accept my help as long as she could pay back immediately. </p><p>It was progress. </p><p>I didn’t bother to hide my smirk as I gazed down, enjoying her trembling body as I continued to massage her wetness, while she still faced away, unable to see my expression. My other hand, on the other hand, started to move, and soon found the edge of her top, slowly pulling it up, revealing more of more of her beautiful skin. </p><p>It was only interrupted by her bra, but considering it was a sexy lacy piece, it was hardly a bother. </p><p>She said nothing as she raised her arms, allowing me to pull off her top, comfortable with her partial nudity even in her office. Not a surprise considering everything we had done. </p><p>After a while, changed her position, and sat on my lap. The ointment I rubbed on her ruined my pants somewhat, but I knew from the experience that it was nothing dry cleaning wouldn’t fix, so I didn’t let it bother me. </p><p>She hugged me once again, but not before reaching for her back and freeing her breasts from her bra. I expected her to at least remove my jacket, but instead, she snuggled inside. I understood what she was trying to do a few seconds later. </p><p>She was looking for comfort, one that she found when she was dressed in nothing but a wet g-string while I was still dressed in a full suit. She was trying to convince herself that I wasn’t actually just helping her, but we were making a deal. </p><p>It took all I had to keep my chuckle back, knowing that it would shatter everything I managed to build, but it was amusing that I had to work hard to offer her help. </p><p>Though, as she stayed silent, I couldn’t help but enjoy her radiating beauty. I didn’t tell her that, as it would run contrary to the excuse she was doing her best to create for herself. Instead, I slipped my hand between her legs, a finger slipping into her core, triggering a spectacularly beautiful moan. </p><p>I didn’t take it slow, but drilled her with two fingers until she was at the edge — a destination that she reached quickly after the extended massage — before stopping and letting her catch her breath … then repeating thrice more, until the sweetness of the edge turned tantalizingly bitter. </p><p>Distracting her from the pointless determination that kept her from asking for help. </p><p>“I … I’m afraid about the corporate reorganization project,” Natalie admitted. </p><p>“What project?” I asked, surprised, which earned her surprised gaze. </p><p>“Don’t you know? The CEO had just launched a nationwide reorganization that will change the whole branch structure.” </p><p>“I didn’t receive the mail. Don’t forget. Officially, I’m just a sales manager, not a part of the upper management,” I reminded. “Now, why don’t you tell me exactly what’s going on so I see if I can …” I started, about to finish questioning whether I could help or not, then remembered exactly how my night with Dorothy had been concluded. “ … determine the exact price you have to pay for my help.” </p><p>Hearing the confidence in my tone, Natalie smiled for the first time since I arrived at her office. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I said nothing as she freed my shaft from my pants, just enjoying the shape her full breasts took as she leaned against my legs. It would be a pity to leave them unattended while she was busy, so I captured them while she prepared to capture the head of my shaft. </p><p>“A delicious dessert. You’re so thoughtful, sir,” she whispered before she completed the move. I just smiled, enjoying the moment. It wasn’t the first time I received an under-the-desk blowjob from a secretary, but Umi was a delicious combination of innocent and naughty to allow her to take one of the top spots easily. </p><p>She dipped down a bit, enjoying the taste for a while, but then, to my surprise, she pulled back. </p><p>That surprise didn’t last long. She used the opportunity to wrap her breasts around the base of my shaft and move, and used one of her hands on the tip. “A dessert needs to be savored, isn’t it so, sir,” she said, with just a bit of smugness in her tone. </p><p>She clearly wanted to tease me just like I did earlier. </p><p>I said nothing, as it was not exactly a hardship to receive a slow, lingering titjob from her beautiful breasts, especially when I was sure that she would be the first one to surrender. She moved up and down slowly. “Let me help,” I said, taking the responsibility of pushing her breasts together, leaving her hands free for other things. </p><p>She said nothing, just shifted one hand to my balls, gently caressing, while the other focused on the top, all the while her breasts danced around the base. </p><p>Another spectacular show. I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed caressing her breasts softly while I helped her. </p><p>Just like I expected, she was the first one to surrender. The pleasures of the flesh were too new for her to resist properly, especially when combined with the excitement of doing it in the office. She threw her head back, moaning. I allowed her to pull back. </p><p>When she looked down again, her beautiful black hair spilled over her beautiful breasts, but she didn’t even bother fixing it before she caught my length between her lips once more, dancing up and down. </p><p>I pushed her hair away, revealing her beautiful breasts and her enthusiastic face at the same time. Her expression was split between desire and determination as she pushed down, devouring half of my length with one move. </p><p>She gagged, but she didn’t let it stop her before she repeated it, determined to overcome her limited experience through sheer will. </p><p>Beautiful, but it was scary to imagine how good she would be once she was more experienced. Well, it would have been, if it wasn’t for my overactive libido. </p><p>As she pushed up and down, she showed that her inexperience was hardly a barrier. She did her best to put on an excellent show despite her inexperience, once again proving the benefits of enthusiasm over experience when it came to hiring the right employee. </p><p>“You need to work harder if you want to impress me,” I said, unable to resist the temptation to tease her. She didn’t say anything, but she picked up the pace, which was already an excellent answer. </p><p>I chucked even as I reached my desk, pulled the documents I needed to sign today, and started working. They weren’t particularly urgent, but Umi’s expression of shock when I easily ignored the pleasure and started working was beautiful. </p><p>Still, I didn’t neglect to look down and wink at her, showing that it was a challenge for her rather than a dismissal. I didn’t want to damage her enthusiasm by making her think she wasn’t any good at giving a blowjob. </p><p>She didn’t say anything when she pulled back, just took a deep breath before she grabbed my legs for leverage. Then she pushed down, throating almost all of my length. Not easily, though, as I could already see her makeup starting to run as her eyes watered, her gags and gasps getting loud enough to make me glad for the isolation of the room. </p><p>Yet, I continued reading and signing documents — I never signed even routine paperwork without understanding its function — her attempts to keep my attention on her failing spectacularly. </p><p>That didn’t discourage her. A minute, two minutes, five minutes … she continued, only taking a break when she needed to catch her breath, and even then, only as a momentary pause before she returned to her task. </p><p>She might have failed to keep me away from the paperwork, but her dedication was still rewarded. I exploded into her mouth without a warning, which caught her by surprise as she pulled back, and quite a bit of my load landed on her face. </p><p>Looking rather spectacular when combined with her messed makeup. </p><p>“I hope you enjoyed your dessert,” I said as I pushed the paperwork to the side before I pushed my chair back slightly, and lifted her to the desk. “Now, it’s time for my dessert.” </p><p>I might have cummed seconds ago, but the sight of Umi, her face marked properly, her blouse open, and her skirt rolled up, created a view that was more than enough to bring it back to life. </p><p>Especially when she said nothing, just lay on her back, and parted her legs open invitingly. It was an invitation I took happily, pushing forward to invade her core. Her eyes closed as she moaned freely, her legs wrapping around my waist like she was afraid of me retreating. </p><p>I had no such intention, but it was one of the things that was better to show than tell. I guided my presence inside her wetness again and again, her moans getting louder with each push. “Try to keep your voice down,” I warned her. “My office is out of the way, but the isolation of the room was not good enough to suppress your beautiful cries,” I reminded her. </p><p>She tensed in an instant as she bit her lips, keeping her voice down.  Her legs stayed tight around my waist, so I didn’t stop impaling her, her breasts dancing freely with each push, even when she was on her back. </p><p>They were truly spectacular. </p><p>I rocked back and forth mercilessly, pushing more and more inside of her with each push, stretching her around my presence. “You’re making excellent progress toward that Paris trip,” I said even as I reached and twisted her nipples, forcing a moan of her.</p><p>“T-thank you, sir,” she managed to whisper between her suppressed moans, while one of my hands slid down her waist and landed on her ass. Her ass might not be as spectacular as her breasts, but it was still amazing enough that neglecting was a crime. </p><p>It was getting harder and harder for her to keep her moans down as I penetrated her deeper and deeper, my hands getting tighter on the soft flesh of her ass. </p><p>She started shivering, her climax impossible to hide as her legs loosened. I was yet to cum, but I pulled back deliberately and sat back, my shaft hard and glistening. She lay on the table, enjoying her orgasm for a while before she shifted her position. “Sir?” she asked as she sat on the edge of the desk, looking at my hard shaft.</p><p>“Well, since it’s your first day, I decided to take it slow,” I said, chuckling at her shocked expression. Understandable. It didn’t sound like me. “So, you can stop and clean yourself if you want?” </p><p>“And if I do that?” </p><p>“No punishment,” I said. Then, I smirked. “I’m sure Brenda would have no problem finishing what you started,” I added, goading her into action.</p><p>It was never too late to build a little workplace rivalry, while also making sure she grew no unrealistic dreams of actually being my exclusive girlfriend or something like that. A subtle hint of being replaced for underperformance without coming across as a threat was a good way to create a foundation. </p><p>“There’s no need for it,” she growled, her face, still messy, turning into a sexy show. “I can handle it, don’t worry about it.” </p><p>She left the desk turned her back to me, and pushed herself down, taking the entirety of length before she started rocking hard, determined to prove there was no need for Brenda to visit. She closed her eyes as the pleasure built up inside her once more, doing her best to share that feeling with me. </p><p>Ordinarily, I preferred a variety of positions, but as I watched Umi do her best to prove Brenda’s assistance unnecessary, I decided to maintain the position that left her in control. It was another layer of commitment to her new job, one that couldn’t justify no matter how much she twisted the situation. </p><p>I only intervened when I was about to explode. I grabbed her hips, pinning her in place, filling her with my mark once more. It triggered another orgasm, and she leaned back, dazed. “H-how was it, sir,” she whispered. </p><p>“Enough to earn a beautiful business trip to Paris,” I whispered as I slapped her ass, then pointed to the connected private bathroom. “Now, go and clean up. I want my secretary to look prim and perfect … when outside my office.” </p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said as she followed my order. </p><p>Watching her walk away while my seed slowly seeped out of her was beautiful… </p>",

    "content": "<p>My first reaction as I suddenly found myself in a battle, especially when I was supposed to be doing an infiltration mission and nothing else, was to curse. </p><p>Only in my mind, of course. Because, as the new recruits, we were supposed to have fallen unconscious. I used the opportunity to observe and decide on an action. </p><p>The first thing I realized was that the city was not ready for a battle, their citizens attacking slowly but steadily … but neither were the elementals. Their numbers looked impressive, but they came across as a disorganized wave. </p><p>A surprising battle for both sides. </p><p>Admittedly, it was a good opportunity for me to follow the suggestion that came from the voice. As the chaos raged, I could sneak toward the center of the city and do what the voice asked me to. There was only one problem. </p><p>I didn’t trust it. </p><p>I was reasonably sure that the voice was the thing that was responsible for my unique brand of the System, but I had long concluded that that didn’t mean I would trust them. Triggering a battle without even asking my opinion to force my hand didn’t make things any better. </p><p>What really annoyed me was that it didn’t really matter whether I trusted the voice or not. I needed to act. </p><p>Even before seeing the city, I was aware that the Eternals were a dangerous enemy, one that could turn my life into hell if they were aware of my existence. Anonymity had been my greatest weapon. That feeling only intensified when I saw the true base of the Eternals. They had been more passive than even I expected, lost in their own world, happy with all the Divine Spark they collected through the System, and by exchanging with the gods. </p><p>If they won the battle, it was inevitable that they would turn more active. If they did, it was very likely that they would discover my presence sooner or later, forcing us to retreat and abandon everything, which would likely include the two planes that were under our control. </p><p>One way or another, I had to act. </p><p>The guards who were responsible for the recruitment effort were distracted by the battle, making it easy for me to slip out and move deeper into the city. I ignored the tall crystal towers and the beautiful gardens while I searched for a place to hide. </p><p>And, focused on my connection with Helga. It was an invasive spell, one that inevitably left a mark on the protective barrier, but the Eternals had bigger things to worry about. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Helga asked. </p><p>“I need you to test whether the System currently having any problems?” I asked. “Any drop in power, or slowing communication,” I asked? </p><p>“No, why?” she answered after a moment. </p><p>I gave her a quick summary of the battle. “I wanted to validate what the System had been telling me about it being trapped at the Eternal City,” I said. “But, it’s clearly a lie. The planar border of the material plane is strong enough to interfere with the communication.” </p><p>“It’s probably what’s shacking them,” Helga guessed. “They will be free if you destroy them.” </p><p>“And, there’s a chance they’ll get free even if the battle goes on long enough. With the planar border in between, there had to be some limitations.” </p><p>“True,” Helga answered. “I might discover the real location if that’s true. There has to be some signs.” </p><p>“Excellent, you focus on that, and alert me if there’s anything wrong,” I said, giving her the task. </p><p>Then, I interrupted the connection. Just in time, a being I didn’t recognize rushed toward me, carrying a sword that was glowing with a dangerous amount of pure air mana. An eternal guard, I recognized even as I faded into the background, gathering enough life energy to counteract the assault. </p><p>I paid attention to his armor, which was a work of art, with many different decorations covering its surface. Their operations were a mystery to me, but I could still see that he was a high-ranking one. </p><p>However, I was surprised by their daring to use elemental mana even when they were being attacked by the elementals. </p><p>Then again, maybe that was why he was assigned to guard duty rather than the front lines. </p><p>As he was rushed forward, I waited for an opportunity to ambush him. Which didn’t work, as the moment he arrived, a gentle wind covered every inch of the alley, and he turned toward me. A dangerously competent mage. </p><p>And, also a demigod that was stronger than an ordinary avatar, I realized even as he swung his sword, and the whole alley filled with sharp mana blades. If it wasn’t for the corrupted angel’s nice gift, it would have been a fight that would make me struggle. </p><p>Instead, I scooped a huge amount of primordial aether — one that was available to be reached in a sub-dimension of the city — turned it into mana, and teleported right behind him. </p><p>Punching through the wards was supposed to prevent that. </p><p>He was surprised by my achievement, but he reacted quickly, his blades reversing direction. Too bad he wasn’t fast enough to match with my new stats. I punched through his chest, the armor crumbling under my mana-reinforced punch, and used the closeness to invade his body with Tantric mana. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was the Divine Spark, an amount that was considerably less than I had expected. From his display that was strong enough to match an Avatar, I expected him to have around a million Divine Sparks, not just barely thirty-thousand. </p><p>But, it was arranged in a mysterious pattern, as if it was designed to be channeled only in specific ways. It restricted the flexibility greatly, but there was no doubt about the impact. </p><p>[+32,193 Divine Air Spark]</p><p>I didn’t purify the result. Even if it was Divine Spark and not actually an elemental spark, it might help me find a way to cure Titania’s ailment. </p><p>The moment I killed him, I triggered an explosion by flooding his body with the twilight spark, though I made sure to lean in the darkness aspect to make it look like the unique mixture of the angel I had killed. Then, I went a step further and wore his visage as an illusion.</p><p>There was no harm in creating a fake culprit. </p><p>I flew away for a while, watching as several Eternals approached from a distance before I dove down to another alley. I had to admit, the acquisition of the Air Spark had been timely, as it allowed me to create several fake elementals around me, which then attacked the ones that chased me. </p><p>“Alarm the defensive lines, some elementals have slipped through the defenses,” one of the leaders shouted even as he chopped the fake elementals down without even realizing they were fake ones. </p><p>My subterfuge habit once again proved to be useful. </p><p>Once I avoided the chase, I moved around until I found a spot that could help me observe the battle and allow me to take the next step. </p><p>First, I examined the border of the city. A huge mana shield, one that could rival a planar border, was around the city, keeping the Primordial Aether out, showing that the city could easily function as an artificial plane. </p><p>However, just like a plane, it was unable to resist a more focused assault. At several points, the elementals breached the defenses, forcing a melee. A wind of Primordial Aether accompanied their breach, but some kind of defensive spell interfered immediately and shuffled the Primordial Aether into some kind of sub-dimension to slowly break into Aether, then to mana. </p><p>They probably had no idea that they gave me near-infinite mana through that method. </p><p>A good advantage, one that I could use to my benefit as I slowly moved deeper into the city. With people searching for a rebel angel, I actually had a good chance to escape. A good thing, as, at the edge, I could see several undead avatars appear and attack the elementals. Their presence didn’t surprise me, as, at this point, the alliance between the Eternals and the undead was not a mystery but a fact. </p><p>With their presence, I expected the battle to end with the Eternal victory, but there were too many elementals gathering, signaling the battle would still take a while. With the teleportation feature of the city being interfered with the System, I had the ability to walk around without a problem, maybe even raid their Divine Spark warehouses.  </p><p>Turning the trap into a treasure. </p><p>Then, just like that, I had managed to curse myself. Someone appeared in the primordial Aether, attacking the undead from behind. </p><p>Someone that I was familiar with. Intensely. </p><p>Marianne. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 160    Charisma: 160</p><p>Precision: 160    Perception: 172</p><p>Agility: 160     Manipulation: 170</p><p>Speed: 160       Intelligence: 220</p><p>Endurance: 231      Wisdom: 192}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 725,291}</p><p>{Divine Air Spark: 32,193}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Analyzing Titania’s soul was a challenge, which was why I invested most of my Purified Spark into my stats. </p><p>[-8,645,700 Purified Spark]</p><p>[+45 All Stats]</p><p>But, even with my increased capability, analyzing it was a challenge. </p><p>As we studied the mysterious elemental energy — which we decided to name Elemental Spark —  that had been infused in Titania’s soul, we reached a conclusion. </p><p>For all its similarities with the Divine Spark, It was impossible to remove, and almost as impossible to control. Worse, it didn’t react to Tantric, removing most of my tools from the play. </p><p>Luckily, Titania was still stabilized, preventing a potential disaster. But, it was only temporary. </p><p>“It looks like I’m going to have to take the risk,” I said to her with a sigh. </p><p>“Are you sure?” Helga answered. “Her situation is still stable. Maybe we could find a solution.” </p><p>“Maybe, but I’m not as hopeful,” I admitted. “For all the similarities, the Elemental Spark has none of the features that make it easy to bond with the human soul,” I said. “It’s clear that they come from the same source, but without the filtering that the Divine Spark receives during its creation process, it’s far more volatile.” </p><p>“Still, we’re making progress —” she started, only for me to silence her. </p><p>“No, you’re making progress,” I admitted. “Let’s be honest, without the Tantric working, I’m not exactly a good researcher. It’s far more efficient for you to stay here while I finally try to infiltrate the Eternals,” I said. </p><p>“How are you going to do it?” she asked. </p><p>“Easy, I’m going to infiltrate one of their recruitment teams,” I said. “The other soldiers that I tracked already revealed a few bases, and infiltrating them is very easy. I had already walked around the bases easily,” She looked at me doubtfully. “Well, it’s easy if you can fake soul spaces instantly,” I corrected. “Most of their access points are reliant on checking a specific soul-space signature, and I can fake it easily enough.” </p><p>Which was a big security gap, but I didn’t blame the Eternals for it. After all, who would have guessed that their unique achievement would have been invalidated? </p><p>“Are we sure that we’re going to find the answers about the Elemental Spark there?” she asked. </p><p>“Inevitably,” I answered. “There has to be a reason why the elementals are desperately trying to invade this plane while not bothering with the others,” I said, revealing my approach. Then, after one last kiss, I teleported away. </p><p>Right in the middle of one of the recruitment bases, an illusion already covering my face perfectly. After my improved stats, the illusions I used looked real … not that it mattered. The guards at the teleportation room just checked my identity through their artifact, and a tendril of mana touched my fake soul space, which perfectly copied the soldier I had replaced. </p><p>I didn’t care much about the base itself as I moved forward. A turn through a corridor, and soon, I was at the room where the new recruits had been held. A little adjustment to the paperwork, was an illusion, and I was among the crowd.  </p><p>No one even noticed it. After all, the new recruits consisted of hundreds of people, all waiting to be transported into the main base to expand their soul space forcefully. And, once they leveled up, they would be brought to one of the trial grounds — like the one I had stumbled on when I met with my dragon friend — to see which ones would survive the transformation without going berserk. </p><p>A journey I wouldn’t be joining them. </p><p>I needed to reach their base. </p><p>I stayed at the base for six hours before the guards ordered us to visit a teleportation array. Of course, the base didn’t teleport that many recruits every day. Some of the recruits had been waiting for her for weeks … but I had already known the delivery date for this base was close. It was the reason I picked the timing. </p><p>I stayed in the middle of the crowd as we were led to our destination, finally about to visit the main Eternals’ base, which I failed to discover despite how much I worked. </p><p>I stopped at the teleportation array, and the world shifted… I found myself in another closed room. </p><p>Ironically, the moment I stepped into the base, I discovered the reason why I wasn’t able to find the location of the base. </p><p>We were flying, which was obvious from the location of both Helga and Oeyne. </p><p>Not just flying, I noticed after a moment, that I felt a smooth flicker, and our location changed significantly. The base was not just flying, but also teleporting in some frequency. </p><p>No wonder I wasn’t able to pinpoint its location during my searches. </p><p>The new recruits had gone through a very detailed process, checking our soul spaces three different times to make sure there was nothing wrong. Unfortunately for them, that proved to be ineffective. I stayed undetected, and was soon directed to a room with all the others. </p><p>It was a fascinating room. A huge, impressive tower, one that gave me the first glimpse of their base through a large window. </p><p>I ignored the speech one of the Eternals delivered — one that included a long story about the honor and mission, laced with a lot of mind-altering spells to develop a subconscious sense of loyalty — in favor of examining the base. </p><p>The first thing: it was not a base, but a fully-fledged city, one that easily housed tens of millions of people, which made me change my impression quite a bit. A fully-fledged, flying city, one that could teleport fully. Not exactly a simple enemy.</p><p>At a distance, I could see the Eternals were a far more egalitarian crowd. At a distance, I could see angels, dragons, phoenixes, and many beings I didn’t recognize flying, and on the ground, and on the ground, I was able to recognize many races, elves, humans, and many others that were supposed to be extinct. </p><p>A far more egalitarian crowd than I expected. Worse, in many of them, I could see the signs of Divine Spark, far better integrated than the corrupted angel I killed — though none of them looked like they were trying to mix two types. </p><p>I wondered if the gods they had been trading with were aware of the truth of the matter. </p><p>However, as I watched them, I understood why the elementals were constantly trying to invade the area as well. There were huge four artifacts, one at each corner of the flying city, and in each, an elemental was trapped, each taller than a mile. </p><p>I didn’t know their function. Maybe they were there as trophies, or maybe they were generating the force that allowed the huge city to fly. Either way, they looked far stronger than the other elementals that attacked the plane. </p><p>I had to admit, at this moment, I questioned my whole plan. I had expected to face a formidable enemy at the base … but what I found here was far too strong. Not something I could fight even if I pushed my stats ten times higher. </p><p>Even sneaking around felt dangerous. </p><p>Maybe Helga was right. Slowly exploring Titania’s affliction was the better option. I would have turned and left, but it would just alert my enemies. So, I stayed, waiting for the process to end so I could escape. </p><p>The speech was over soon. “Prepare for the enlightenment!” the speaker shouted.</p><p>And the building was filled with mana. A very familiar form of it. </p><p>Tantric Mana. </p><p>I stretched my own control to the nearby recruits, examining their soul spaces to fake my own. I was shocked by the process … as it was far more aggressive and incompetent than I expected. The Tantric mana felt forceful and uncontrolled, damaging the soul spaces it targeted even as it left many problems. </p><p>At first, I thought it to be accidental, that whatever Eternals using to control the mana lacked control, but the more I examined, the more I realized the problem had a different source. There were two controllers for the mana. </p><p>One controller did its best to stabilize the flow, while the other did its best to turn it into a destructive mess, trying to destroy every single System user. </p><p>I already had a feeling about the identity of the second controller … but, I realized that it was not a one-way process. </p><p>YOU’RE HERE, SAVE ME! FREE THE ELEMENTAL LORDS!</p><p>The words echoed in my mind, showing that I had been detected. That would have been bad enough … if it wasn’t accompanied by a sudden shift. The city teleported again, but this time, we weren’t anywhere at the main material plane, but floating in Primordial Aether directly. </p><p>The creatures rushed forward, while at the same time, a huge army of elementals rushed from all directions, flooding from the primordial aether, and forcing the city to defend. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>—</p><p>{Strength: 160    Charisma: 160</p><p>Precision: 160    Perception: 172</p><p>Agility: 160     Manipulation: 170</p><p>Speed: 160       Intelligence: 220</p><p>Endurance: 231      Wisdom: 192}</p><p>{Purified Divine Spark: 725,291}</p><p>{ADDITIONAL SPARKS</p><p>Twilight - Chosen 30</p><p>Nature - Chosen 10</p><p>Knowledge - Chosen 10}</p><p>{GODDESSES</p><p>Elven Goddess</p><p>Goddess of Knowledge</p><p>Twilight Archangel</p><p>Goddess of the Forge}</p>",

    "content": "<p>Barbara was sitting in her room, bored out of her mind. She made the mistake of promising someone from her class that she would go to a party … but she was not in the mood. After the day she had at work, she wasn’t in the mood. </p><p>Unfortunately, it was also the reason why she was sitting alone in her room with the lights turned off. After all, her excuse was that she had to go back home for an emergency. It wouldn’t do well if someone actually noticed the light. </p><p>She couldn’t even say that it was her roommate, not with Lily’s habit of rarely staying in the room. Though, Barbara had to admit, she was jealous. Lily had a sister rich enough that they could afford to pay for the overpriced dorms, just so that she had a place to crash occasionally. </p><p>Meanwhile, Barbara had to work part-time just to keep her student loans manageable. She wanted to complain, but at least it allowed her to live alone without paying any extra. Also, altogether, while she could be bitchy sometimes, Lily was not a bad roommate. </p><p>Which was why, when the door opened without a warning and Lily entered, Barbara was surprised and annoyed at the same time. “Hey, B. What are you doing here with the lights closed? Also, aren’t you supposed to be at a party?” </p><p>Barbara sighed. “I was, but I had a bad day, so I decided to rest.” </p><p>“Oh, really. That’s inconvenient,” Lily said, though as she walked closer, Barbara knew exactly what she was talking about. She had a date. No need to wear that ridiculous top that covered almost none of her breasts otherwise. </p><p>“Don’t tell me you need the room,” Barbara said with a sigh, but even as she asked that, she knew the answer she would receive. There was no reason for her to pull her shirt folded up to display more if the partner in question wasn’t somewhere close. </p><p>“Unfortunately, I do. Sorry,” Lily said. She didn’t sound particularly sorry. “But, you told me that you would be at the party, and I made the same arrangements.” </p><p>“And, I’m guessing it’s out of the question that I can stay in the room.” </p><p>“Not unless you’re willing to join,” Lily answered with a chuckle. </p><p>“Oh, a tempting suggestion, but I rather visit the party,” Barbara answered. The last thing she needed was to deal with the usual two-pump frat boy who thought himself an incredible lover. But when the door opened … and who entered was certainly not a boy. </p><p>“This is Darion,” Lily introduced. </p><p>“I’m guessing, football player,” Barbara guessed.</p><p>“Unfortunately, no,” Darion answered. “Actually, not a student altogether.” </p><p>“He works in my sister’s company,” Lily said, her smile naughty. </p><p>“Yes, I do … stuff,” Darion added, his smirk making her insides tingle. Barbara thought about changing her mind about the invitation, as it was certainly tempting. “This is your bed, right?” Darion said as he jumped up. </p><p>“Yes, help me up,” she said. </p><p>“I think that’s my cue to leave,” Barbara said with a smile and left the room, shocked by just how forward Lily was acting. </p><p>Not that she blamed her. </p><p>“Actually, why don’t I tease them a bit,” she spoke to herself as she turned and opened the door, ready to interrupt them before they got a bit hot and heavy. A good little revenge for forcing her to go back to the party. </p><p>Only to realize she was already too late. “Wow, they are fast…” she murmured, waiting for them to notice her … but then, they did not. Barbara felt herself tempted, and sneaked in, moving behind the dresser. </p><p>“Damn, they are fast,” Barbara whispered even as she watched them cycled between positions, each more erotic than the last. “Well, Lily already invited me,” she murmured, ignoring her guilt as she started playing with herself.</p><p>Then, she was tempted to do even more. She sneaked the couch under the bed, got rid of her shirt, and started playing with herself. The fear of getting caught sent her heart out of control. They looked too distracted to catch her. </p><p>And, if they did, she would just accept her punishment.</p>",

    "content": "<p>She said nothing as she dragged me to a huge bedroom and threw me to her bed. More daring than I was used to, but the speed she was able to throw me suggested that Elsana liked having control in the bedroom. </p><p>I was more interested in the speed she climbed onto the bed right next to me, showing that all those poems and sexy gazes were not for nothing. She was already panting with desire, which she didn’t bother to hide. </p><p>It was ill-advised, maybe, but I was already aroused before she fed me a pill that made my blood boil with heat and desire, so instead of letting her play, I grabbed her waist, and flipped our position. She was strong enough to prevent that, of course, but she let that happen even though she ended up on her back. </p><p>“Well, you look enthusiastic,” she said as she grabbed my shirt with one hand, then ripped it off without showing the slightest strain, showing just how strong she was physically. </p><p>I just leaned and captured her lips. Her eyes widened in surprise as my tongue invaded her mouth, but when she responded, her tongue danced skillfully. At the same time, she quickly ripped the rest of my clothes easily. </p><p>I understood the reason for the pill she had fed me. She wasn’t being metaphorical when she mentioned she needed my warmth. Her essence was freezing, and as we shared a kiss, it invaded my body. It might have been dangerous if it wasn’t for the pill she fed to me earlier.</p><p>As I kissed her, my hands danced on her cold yet warm skin, using not only my lifetime of experience, but also the massage skills I had learned, which helped the cold to start moving slightly. </p><p>“Not bad, you know how to massage,” she said. “Just ordinary technique, of course, but good expertise.”  </p><p>“I’m always open to constructive criticism, Master Elsana,” I said seductively before I let my lips slide down and start sucking her neck.  </p><p>“Maybe later. I’m feeling impatient,” she said as she tightened her hips around me and flipped, and I ended up under her. At the same time, she managed to get rid of her corset and her skirt, leaving her in panties only. </p><p>“You are beautiful,” I said. </p><p>“I - I,” she stammered, not expecting the compliment, but that didn’t last long, not when she remembered her exact state of undress. “Enough talking,” she said far more confidently as she captured my lips, letting her body rub against mine. </p><p>Her cold essence infused my body aggressively, overwhelming the pill she fed to me somewhat. Luckily, her best friend’s technique countered hers, so I carefully converted some of my essence through Volcano Technique, easily countering her essence. </p><p>An unexpected benefit. </p><p>She could have stopped me easily as I pulled her panties to the side, but instead, she paused her hips slightly, giving me the time I needed to align with her entrance. </p><p>I slipped inside, and she moaned. “You’re very impatient —” she started, trying to sound dissatisfied, but that contrasted with her moan. And the speed her hips moved as she rode me aggressively. She was not a virgin, but every move of hers made it clear that it had been a while since she had a bed partner. </p><p>Quite a while, even. </p><p>I let my hands dance over her body, desperate to discover her sensitive spots. Fascinatingly, my budding massage talent helped me with it greatly. As the pleasure infused her body, she picked up the pace, her tunnel tightening around me like a clamp. </p><p>It was impossible to keep back my growing explosion … nor I could keep myself when she moaned even louder, her sudden flood signaling her climax. “Well, that was quick,” I said smugly even as I flipped her, not stopping even for a moment. </p><p>One big advantage of her cultivation, she was strong enough to handle the aftermath of her climax. As for the consequences … well, she was a super pharmacist, so I didn’t need to worry about it. </p><p>“You’re pretty arrogant for a traveling scholar,” she said, trying to sound confident, but it was a difficult mood to maintain as her chest heaved up and down. </p><p>“Some effort is necessary to keep such a magnificent woman satisfied,” I said even as I started moving. After my climax, I felt the warmth from the pill she fed me weaken, but luckily, reinforcing it subtly with the Volcano Hammer technique was easy. </p><p>I wouldn’t risk acting in such a forward manner in other circumstances, but after her climax, Elsana was vulnerable to pleasure enough to make the risks manageable. I continued moving back and forth, each repeat pushing her pleasure higher and higher. </p><p>The results were spectacular, owing to the long break she had taken from the bedroom activities. A pity considering her beauty. Someone like her needed to be pampered more … later. </p><p>Tonight was about a nice, proper hard fuck. </p><p> I drilled her hard, enjoying her moans. I had always been good in bed — there was a reason I was able to keep those rich and bored ladies interested in me — and while a part of it was about my good looks and even better stamina, my ability to read my partner needed help even more. </p><p>And, at this moment, Elsana needed nothing more than a proper, hardcore, merciless fucking.  I pushed, and her hips followed my rhythm instinctively. Soon, her legs closed around my hips, tight enough that I couldn’t escape. </p><p>Her level of power made sure of it. </p><p>As I drilled, I used my newly acquired massage skills to the limit, teasing her. “Try to move your hands slower. It’ll help the essence move slowly,” she commented. </p><p>“As you wish, madam,” I said with a big smirk. “Any other suggestions.” As I said that, my hips quickened. I wanted to make sure that I enjoyed receiving orders.   </p><p>The opportunity to improve my skills was too useful to skip. </p><p>“Try to press your finger to my collarbone harder. There’s an acupuncture point there. Even as an Initiate, it’ll help you move my martial essence,” she suggested. I did so, even cheating somewhat with the Volcano Essence, and she moaned even harder. “That’s good—” she said, interrupted by another moan as I twisted her nipple. </p><p>Daring, but clearly enjoyed it. </p><p>She moaned even harder once I flipped her and took her from behind while I caressed her spine, though she maintained enough presence of mind to give me some suggestions. The idea of slowly massaging her for hours, until she started begging for me for a release was tempting. </p><p>Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked to spend hours like that, there were two problems. First, Lannayin was supposed to visit after her meeting was over, and with her personality, it wasn’t impossible for her to breach in. </p><p>Also, it was dangerous to try to control Elsana, even for her fun. I still didn’t have a good hold of her personality, so I didn’t want to push my luck too much. </p><p>Instead, I continued delivering my combined pleasure assault, the soft massage contrasting with the aggressive invasion. She gasped and moaned, occasionally interrupted by some suggestions to enhance my massage skills. </p><p>With her medical skills, that advice was spot on. </p><p>I accepted all, and focused on keeping her happy … but when we climaxed again, the chill hit even harder. Using Volcano Essence was tempting, but too risky, so I made a point of trembling to show the cold infused me deeply. </p><p>“Servants already prepared a bath for you. Just go and stay submerged until the chill is gone completely,” she said, dismissing me from her room casually. </p>",

    "content": "<p>I ignored the gazes of the others as we walked out of the Arena, Elsana walking next to me. She said nothing until we arrived at a carriage, which was more luxurious than the room I rented at the inn. </p><p>There was a maid inside, waiting for her, but she made a gesture to send her away, leaving us alone in the carriage. I sat down, doing my best to look slightly surprised by the decoration — to remind her that I came from a rich family, but not one that matched her splendor —  which also gave me an excuse not to notice her slight tenseness. </p><p>She was playing a game with her friend with me as the prize, so I couldn’t be smart enough to catch the game. The misconceptions of the world helped me. Back on Earth, people had a tendency to assume rich people to be smart and wise, and here, they overestimated the brave and the strong. </p><p>And, I had already proved myself a coward by rejecting an important challenge, which helped people to underestimate me greatly even with my scholarly abilities. </p><p>“Those poems were beautiful,” Elsana commented in a lighthearted manner. Too lighthearted, like a girlfriend asking whether I had ever seen my ex lately. An obvious trap that somehow most men fell continuously. </p><p>For me, it was a unique challenge. I could avoid it, but that would reveal a level of awareness that would damage my objectives. I could fall into it directly by acting silly, but I was locked in a room with a beautiful woman who was even more dangerous than usual. </p><p>In the end, I decided to take a dangerous bet, one that could pay great dividends. I crossed my hands, and put a dazed expression on my face. “Watching her in her natural element and forge weapon after weapon has inspired me. The way the light of the forge crowned her face, the way her arms tightened as the hammer exploded against the anvil…” I said before I let my voice fade into a whisper. </p><p>For the first time, Elsana failed to hide her jealousy. Which was hard to decide whether it was good or bad. “Maybe you should watch me refine some pills, then. It might inspire you,” she said, her voice soft yet threatening. </p><p>I ignored the implicit threat, and instead put a fawning expression on my face, like I was captivated by the idea. “Really, it would be my honor!” I gasped. </p><p>She set her hands on her lap while her brow rose curiously. “Interesting. Maybe we should,” she said. Then, she pointed to the booklet in my hands. “What’s that,” she said. </p><p>“A small guide about the martial arts styles of the city,” I said sheepishly. “Since my martial comprehension is poor, Commander Falnaher granted it to help me.” </p><p>“Did it help?” she said. </p><p>I pushed another smile on my face, this time tense. “Not much, I’m afraid. My martial talent is not enough to comprehend anything from a booklet,” I claimed, afraid that she would pass a manuscript to me for the express purpose of making me compose poems. It would be a trade, which wouldn’t trigger the System. </p><p>Maybe it would not, as the System could be temperamental, but I didn’t want to risk it. </p><p> “But, at least, it will be a good gift for my brother. He would love to see some drawings about the local martial arts techniques,” I said. </p><p>She shook her head, but then chuckled. Before she could say anything, the carriage came to a stop, and the door opened. </p><p>We were already in her compound. The moment I took a breath, a hundred different types of flowers and other plants filled my heart. The compound was mostly filled with gardens and greenhouses, with occasional small houses and workshops. </p><p>Only the large mansion at the center of the walled compound was the exception. Elsana walked forward, occasionally nodding and gesturing at the surprising number of servants that worked around, wearing various colors and types of uniforms that indicated their position. </p><p>She smiled at the door, entertained by my wide-eyed glances as I took the sights. Admittedly, it was impressive enough that I didn’t need to fake anything. “Let me show you around,”  she said, and led me to a library that shocked me with its size. There were a few apprentices that were already in, indicating that it wasn’t highly confidential, but the guards at the door showed it was clearly still valuable. </p><p>I made sure to put a stammer in my tone as I examined the walls. “M-may I borrow a book?” I said. </p><p>“I’ll do one better, pick a book for yourself,” she said with a generous smile, happy to win over. </p><p>I decided to grab a thick book that was clearly marked as the Initiate section of the Snow Blossom Technique. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30; Pity Bonus - 10]</p><p>[40x Return - Snow Blossom Art, Complete, Mortal Peak-Grade]</p><p>“Oh, an interesting choice,” she said lightly, but I could feel that it was a dangerous one. </p><p>It was time to distract her. I put on a shy smile as I checked her face. “Well, I thought it might help me understand my hostess better,” I said with a shy smile, rather than acting like I was trying to steal her secrets. </p><p>I certainly didn’t want to show that I had succeeded in it.</p><p>“And, you’re interested in your hostess. How daring,” she said with a gentle giggle. One that made her look even more threatening. </p><p>I maintained eye contact for a moment, then avoided her gaze, acting like I was ashamed of my daring words yet still interested, acting like I was unaware of the threatening undertone completely. The smart thing was to ignore the bait … but I was greedy enough to bet that Elsana wouldn’t kill me directly. </p><p>Not because she was a nice person, or it was frowned upon in this new world,  but because it would be hard to explain to her best friend. </p><p>Her face warmed slightly at my words, and gulped slightly. And, to my surprise, it didn’t feel completely fake. “So, you said that you have been inspired by Lannayin’s forging, right?” she said after a long pause. It felt like she made a decision. “Follow me.” </p><p>With that, she led me to another room. Another workshop, I recognized, though instead of a forge, there were a dozen cauldrons, and shelves filled with various plants. There was a fire burning in the room, but that didn’t make the room any less cold. </p><p>It felt unnatural, the same way I felt cold when I looked at the nameplate. </p><p>“First, let’s make sure that you don’t freeze,” she said as she passed me two pills, which luckily triggered the System return. Not just because it confirmed I was on the right path, but also because I didn’t need to be afraid of being poisoned. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30, Pampering Bonus - 10]</p><p>[40x Return - Cold Resistance Martial Pill, Profound Peak-Grade]</p><p>[40x Return - Essence Recovery Martial Pill, Profound Peak-Grade]</p><p>I swallowed both pills without asking questions, and an expression of surprise passed over her expression, replaced by a smile soon after. “You want me to watch Refine a pill, are you sure?” she said as she went behind some kind of screen. </p><p>“It would be my honor —” I said, which turned into a gasp as she walked back, which revealed a new outfit… One that wouldn’t be amiss on a waitress working in a strip club. Not obscene, but close. A pure white corset, and a short skirt. </p><p>“It’s the nature of the Snow Blossom Art,” she said with a confident smile. “To properly refine a pill, I need to immerse myself in cold. I hope you don’t mind.” </p><p>I didn’t need to fake my gulp as I took the view. She was beautiful, even when she grabbed a glistening knife that was made of pure ice, yet looked sharper than the dagger Lannayin gifted me. </p><p>“O-of course not,” I said, pushing the sense of arousal to my tone. Unlike Lannayin, who was too lost in her display to feel any emotion other than pity for my failure to understand her magnificent display, Elsana was wholly aware of her beauty, and wanted to flaunt it. </p><p>“Ice crown glinting, lips like a frosted rose; snowdrifts whisper secrets where her beauty grows. Eyes like glaciers, deep and ever cold, yet in their gaze, a fire burns untold,” I whispered, though, unlike the previous poems I read, I made sure to push a sense of desire in my tone. </p><p>“Oh, what a beautiful poem,” she whispered, trying to look confident, but her blush was hard to misunderstand. </p><p>“C-can you explain what are you doing?” I risked. “It’s … fascinating.”  </p><p>She smiled shyly as she started dicing some kind of plant. “First, I make sure to assess the medicinal potential of the plant, which is different…” she started, which launched a short yet intense lesson. Unlike the first time, she didn’t bother keeping her explanation restricted, going into confusing depths … and I goaded her with poems getting more and more erotic. </p><p>I was surprised by just how well she reacted to my more daring compliments. But maybe, I was wrong. After all, who was mad enough to aggressively court someone who could easily poison them. </p><p>Me, as it turned out. The combination of greed and desire was a dangerous combination. </p><p>Once she finished forging, she threw the pill she finished at me. “Swallow it. I need your help getting warm,” she said. </p><p>Which, I decided to take as an order even as the System did its magic, the reward leaving no doubt about exactly what she planned. </p><p>[Cultivation Difference Bonus - 30, Pampering Bonus - 55 (Capped)]</p><p>[85x Return - Ordinary Medicine Refinement Technique Lesson, Beginner-Major Familiarity]</p><p>[85x Return - Snow Blossom Refinement Lesson, Initiate, Beginner-Minor Familiarity]</p><p>[85x Return - Snow Blossom Refinement Lesson, Muscle Reinforcement, Beginner]</p><p>[85x Return - Burning Blood Pill, Initiate, Yellow Peak-Grade]</p><p>A dangerous reward with an even more dangerous name, but I decided to take the risk nonetheless. I swallowed the pill, and my body got dangerously.  </p><p>She grabbed my hand, her cold skin feeling like a panacea. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Linnayin looked unhappy about the way Falhaner spoke, but I caught her gaze and shook my head, asking her not to push it. I was very happy about the minor insult she delivered. </p><p>More importantly, the System made it clear that she was considerably stronger than Linnayin when it came to fighting. Also, she clearly had a high rank, enough that she could probably kill me without consequence if she wanted. </p><p>Not a good target to annoy. </p><p>Linnayin nodded readily, which confirmed it. She clearly had a hot temper, and the fact that she actually listened showed that she respected Falnahar significantly. </p><p>They turned their attention to the fight. I flipped the booklet she passed to me, which turned out to be a guide about the five martial arts of the city, describing each move for the five arts, both for the initiate realm and muscle reinforcement realm. </p><p>It was a guide to take down the users of the five arts. </p><p>It took a while for me to understand why the System decided to return me the complete manuals rather than a more detailed counter-strategy report. There was no explicit wording in the book about the general intent. </p><p>Valuable information. I also wondered what was the difference between Profound Middle-Grade and Mortal Low-Grade manuals of the same Tiger Fist art, but I wasn’t curious enough to leave early — or worse, pull a book from my Inventory. </p><p>Instead, I turned away from the fight — which the Wolf Fang disciple lost, but not wounded badly — and quickly read through the description of the moves. In a way, the booklet was similar to the Tiger Fist manual. It had similar drawings of the punches, but their descriptions weren’t fully accurate. </p><p>However, there were no poems to accompany the moves. Instead, there were some more practical descriptions of how the essence actually moved. </p><p>It was very easy to understand. Combined with my talent, I just needed to read those descriptions once, and I comprehended the moves, easily able to replicate their moves. </p><p>The difference in difficulty was interesting, but it could wait. I turned my attention to the battles at the arena. After the Muscle Reinforcement disciples, it was followed by several Initiates from all five sects fought.</p><p>It was helpful, as it was the first time I was watching Martial Artists having proper fights. I had already seen many people being killed since I arrived, but it was the first time I watched Martial Artists with equal skills fighting. </p><p>There were no rules to restrict the moves, making the fights far more complicated than sports like boxing. The tactical complexity was high, but my martial aptitude helped me to understand what was going on easily. </p><p>Martial talent was useful. </p><p>As I watched the fights, I didn’t just learn about fighting, but also the political landscape. The attitude of the disciples against each other showed a lot. </p><p>The balance between sects was complicated. Whenever a disciple from Dragon Saber fought others, they took the opponent down in a few hits at most, clearly establishing them as the superior party. Whenever Tiger Fist and Demon Claw fought against the Crane Kick, they worked hard to deliver deep injuries to each other. </p><p>But soon I was distracted by something else. The moves of the Tiger Fist disciples. Maybe because I had already studied their art, but I felt their attacks were lacking spirit. </p><p>Another mystery, but before I could solve it, the door opened, and a familiar blonde beauty entered. </p><p>Apothecary Elsana. </p><p>“It looks like my misplaced guest is here,” she said as she walked. </p><p>“Yes,” Linnayin answered before I could say anything, her tone smug. “That’s what happens when you continue to accept useless people as your disciple.” </p><p>Elsana shrugged as she walked closer. “They have their uses,” she said, but ignored the seat next to Falnaher, and pulled a chair to the other side of me. “Though, sometimes, it’s good to have an excuse to teach them a lesson,” Elsana said, indirectly confirming that she was unaware of what happened earlier, and already punished the culprit. </p><p>“Wait, is that why you kicked out that kid?” Falnaher said. “Lord Eirto visited my father, complaining about your arrogance for an hour.” </p><p>“And, is the city lord going to do anything about it?” Elsana said, which I appreciated. That way, I finally learned Falnaher’s identity. I wasn’t planning to disrespect a martial artist who was significantly stronger than me in the first place, but extra knowledge still helped. </p><p>What didn’t help was the location of the chair, one that was inappropriately close to me, though her smile showed that it was more about goading her friend than actually trying to seduce me, playing to their weird friendship. </p><p>Though, after seeing how Linnayin lived, I understood what Elsana was trying to do better. For all her incredible exotic beauty, Linnayin was a nerd who was more interested in forging. Elsana was clearly using an interesting technique to goad her. </p><p>Not exactly what I had planned when I arrived in the city, but certainly fun. </p><p>“No. You know there’s no love lost between them, but Lord Eire might try to revenge once he leaves the city,” Falnaher declared dismissively. </p><p>“You better hire a few guards. Who knew if he would get impatient and hire a few people to deal with you,” Elsana said. She sounded smug, but she was clearly cluing Lannayin about my predicement and goading her to act at the same time. </p><p>She might not have planned what happened for her lunch invitation, but she was quick to adapt. A dangerous woman. I was glad that I was not her enemy, but a harmless parasite at best. </p><p>“Really, in the city? Would he dare?” Lannayin commented. The other two chuckled in amusement at her naivety. I wanted to join them, but I couldn’t afford to annoy my sexy blacksmith. </p><p>“Well, he managed to get me kicked out of my inn,” I murmured in frustration instead. A risky move, but I didn’t like how my sudden enemies were mentioned in the same breath as the city lord. I needed to leave, the sooner, the better. </p><p>However, before leaving, I wanted to see if I could convince Lannayin to pass me a manual about Volcano Hammer. The full manual was clearly out of the question, but just the initiate section should be doable. </p><p>Particularly since the Initiate section of the Volcano Hammer was truly useless without higher sections.  </p><p>“What, he get you kicked out of the inn,” Lannayin started. “How dare he! I will go and—” </p><p>“Do nothing,” Elsana interrupted as she reached over me to grab her arm, but used it as an opportunity to rub against me in a visible way. Lannayin growled in anger. Elsana continued. “It’s my fault that he is homeless. I will arrange him a place to stay.” </p><p>“That’s not necessary,” Lannayin said with a frosty voice. “He can stay with me. After all, it was my beautiful workshop that inspired his beautiful poem.  </p><p>“Oh, really,” Elsana answered, her smirk wide. “Let me hear them.” </p><p>I ignored my desire to sigh, and repeated the same poem,  followed by a few new ones. Lannayin blushed with each poem, while Elsana looked amused at first. </p><p>Unfortunately, she was too good at keeping her expression hidden. It was too late that I noticed a hint of jealousy on her face. “The last time I visited, you still didn’t have a guest room. Don’t tell me that he’s going to share your pillow like I do,” Elsana said, showing that she decided to play more seriously than I had been expecting. </p><p>I did my best to ignore the following discussion as they argued about who was going to host me, particularly the images that it conjured. It was not a discussion I could intervene. </p><p>Instead, I watched the arena, where another Muscle Reinforcement battle was going on. This time,  it was between Crane Kick and Tiger Fist. My initial plan was to watch the members of the Crane Leg to get a better understanding of their style, but the more I watched, the more I paid attention to Tiger Fist discipline. </p><p>His punches were correct, and his swings were intense as he used the first three punches of the Muscle Reinforcement realm. Outwardly, it was more impressive than the punches I had practiced. My punches were accompanied by the subtlest whisper, while with every punch, his essence roared intimidatingly. </p><p>Yet, for some reason, the roars felt hollow and lacking. The difference was like watching a tiger on the TV screen and hearing it in real time. I wanted to watch that more, but before I could say anything, Elsana grabbed my arm and lifted me. </p><p>I didn’t appreciate being treated like that, but the strength of her fingers left no place to argue. “Then, it’s a deal. He’s going to stay with me until you can put together a decent guest room,” Elsana declared with a teasing smirk. </p><p>“Fine, but once I finish with the meeting, I’m going to visit as well. You can’t be trusted.” </p><p>“Oh, my dear friend. You wound me,” Elsana declared smugly and started walking. Since the decision was made for me, I followed.  </p><p>I didn’t appreciate the process, but that was the cost of being a boy toy. Sometimes, you needed to accept the decisions … especially when those decisions were made by a sexy rich woman in her late twenties, likely strong enough to punch through a wall. </p><p><br></p>",
